LETTER FROM REV. JOIIN OAKLEY.  I did not at once respond to your invitation in July, partly because I thought your circular might more usefully draw out some who had not had my recent opportunities of saying what I thought (an expectation which I am glad to see has not been disappointed), partly because a sudden pressure of other work made it impossible. Since then several short absences from London seem to have been more fatal to letter-writing than a longer one might have been. And now on regaining a little leisure, I find a letter in your columns (of Aug. 4) from my old friend Mr. Hansard, to which—as chairman of the committee which called the conference out of which the correspondence has arisen—l am, perhaps, the fittest person to offer a reply. Mr. Hansard declined to ""take pare"" in our discussions, thinking them "" absolutely useless."" ""It is too late (he thinks) in the day for the clergy to come forward as the promoters and defenders of trade unions."" But I beg leave to say, first that no one reSpuitaibio for the) movement "" came forward"" as a ""promoter and defender of trade unions."" It was probably as complete a surprise to other members of the committee as it was to myself, to find after the first meeting that our line of thought and action was taking, in great measure, that direction. Several members at first stoutly resisted the tendency. We came forward, as we said in our circulars, and in the speeches of all those of us who spoke first, as learners, pure and simple, on a subject of which we felt ignorant, and were ashamed of our ignorance. Some of us had felt an instinctive dislike of being eKpected to say "" Amen "" at the habitual maledictions of the workmen and their unions, especially of the Agricultural Labourers, which no ono will deny to have been current amongst the upper classes, and especially that section of them the religious rich, from whom we seem to be expected to take our political and social opinions ready-made. And some leading members of a society of young clergymen in London, taking up a thread which had been dropped in the Midlands at the time of one of the Church Congresses, decided to try and get some authentic information from the members of the unions themselves, which they have been for the most part ready to give, and have given us most courteously. It specially behoves me to say nothing tending to commit others to opinions about our conferences which they may not share. But, to speak as guardedly as I can, I have no hesitation in saying that much has been learnt, many prejudices dispelled, some accepted accusations against the unions utterly refuted, and an impression of their generally beneficial action, received by most of us, tf not by all, who have attended our conferences. Whether a reciprocal dispersion of delusions has taken place it is not for me to say, but this I do say; to any one who knows anything of the currents of clerical opinion, and the ways in which it is formed, and the tendency of whole classes of the wealthier laity to assert a kind of right to the support of the clergy in any enterprise or line of thought and speech they may have taken up, (as well they may, considering that they have bought and paid for a good many of us, right off),  [PRICE TWOPENCE.  it is plain enough that the mere holding of such conferences at all is clear gain, first to the clergy, and then, I believe, to the Church and to the country. Here, at all events, my friend and I shall not differ very widely. Indeed, I have very little difference whatever with him, when we touch the feelings and convictions at the bottom of both our minds,— though I do regret deeply that he did not see his way to giving us the beneat of his help and counsel when we asked him. But I am quite old enough to remember (albeit as scarcely more than a boy) those earlier movements in which Mr. Hansard was able to take so much more intelligent and active a part; and I do not like to echo the somewhat bitter reflections which he makes for fear of misunderstandings which perhaps he need not fear or feels entitled to disregard. But there is no doubt that his experience of former efforts to bring about a better understanding between the Church and the people has cost us the loss of his co-operation in the present movement—whatever those efforts may or may not have cost him. The fact is the time was not ripe for proclaiming on the house-tops in 1851 that the "" Church of Christ is essentially a democratic Church,"" as Mr. Hansard and Mr. Kingsley tried to do then—with the result which Mr. Hansard truly describes. 1848 was still too recent. In 1877 the time is quite ripe, and a silent revolution is being effected in the Church of England, of which the recent conferences were a mere symptom, and a minor symptom; a revolution which is still only in its earliest stages, and which will certainly witness strange sights—though few, I believe, more beneficial—than that of dignitaries and curates side by side in conference with working men, as to the best means of bringing the social problems of the nineteenth century back into the light of the morality and the ideas of the society founded by Jesus Christ.  If I am asked for the results of our movement, I answer, first, that it is too soon to look for much effect of any kind; second, that the direct good effect to be looked for is just of that general and indefinite kind already pointed to, but which cannot be produced and shown; thirdly, that two direct and not inconsiderable results can already be seen. First is the fact that the subject of trade unions at length finds a place in the programme of the approaching Church Congress at Croydon; that characteristic experiment in developing represen • tative institutions for the Anglican Church (composed at prose .t of such persons only as can take a 7s. 6d. ticket, and, ordinarily, a long railway journey, and live at their own cost for a week in a country town, and no otherwise specially qualified), which in spite of interested disparagement from without, and shortsighted manipulation from within, is rapidly educating Churchmen in the duty of devising some more genuinely democratic organization for what still calls itself the Church of the people, and is still the most powerful national branch of the great Christian Society in the world. Only Churchmen know perhaps all that this fact implies But I assure you that Dissenters need not disdain the victory of having helped to drive the Church, which is still to so large an extent the private property of the peers and the squires, to coal.  Rider seriously what her ministersought to say to the labourers who have dared at length to call their souls their own; and to the artizans who have claimed the same right to combine for selfprotection, as the capitalists have long exercised for self-aggrandisement, and the landed proprietors possess in an hereditary chamber of the legislature, and a House of Commons in which seats cost five thousand pounds! The second result is the useful and interesting correspondence in your columns, and its direct product the instructive and valuable paper of Mr. Lloyd Jones, which I hope may, when completed, see the light in a more permanent form. I wish we could have them to circulate at the forthcoming Congress. If you will let me I will return at another time to one or two of the points with which he deals so successfully. At present I merely observe that a year ago no one would have thought of starting this frank interchange of political and social ideas between the clergy and the people! I hardly know whether Mr. Hansard is more displeased at the youth of some, or the age and dignity of others of our Committee. If it be the former who make him distrustful of us, I entreat him to get rid of all idea that any motive actuated or actuates any of them, but the simple desire to do something, somehow, towards making the Church of England once more in fact as well as in name the Church of the people; and to see if the new popular force of combination be really a hindrance, and might not rather, if better understood, be found a help, in the way of doing We. I can testify that the endeavour has brought together, as I have scarcely ever seen brought together before, those who are called High, Low, and' Broad Churchmen, both older and younger. If it be the dignitaries who stir him to impatient disapproval, I can only say that, for the most part, deans and canons would have small reason to complain of a little gentle laughter at their expense, if they were seen suddenly ""patting the working classes on the back ""—as Mr. Hansard puts it, with the tone of genial laughter in his words. I do not presume, with him, either to criticise, or apologise for ""the superior clergy."" But the plain fact is that none of those who have joined us need any apology for leading a popular movement, beyond the antecedents of their own lives. Mr. Cremer's—or was it Mr. Howell's—suggestive question to us—which Mr. Hansard practically echoes—"" Where were you all 30 years ago ? ""—is one which, whether to the point or not, in the case of most of us scarcely admits of an explicit answer! But some of us were certainly laying the gound for our present action. A quarter of a century ago Mr. Hansard had no doubt laid the foundations of his life-long liberalism in the Rugby of Dr. Arnold. For another, I was probably learning many lessons (besides my Latin gramme)) from the struggles and the fate of another reforming clergyman and Schoolmaster, Mr. Whiston, of Rochester. And it is only fair to assume that others, who now get scanty thanks for seeming to enter without due acknowledgment into the labours of those honoured friends of Mr. Hansard's, who called themselves Christian Socialists, have no more forgotten those earlier thinkers and workers than the present writer has. And it may reasonably be supposed that in silent study, and thought, and observation, some of them were laying the foundation of that high culture, wide learning, and praotical sagacity, which have since given us—for example, the most popular, religious book of our day (I refer to Dr. Farrar's ""Life of Christ,"") and have taught others to combine with their rare refinement and still rarer condition, the popular sympathy and faculty of adaptation, which have known h‘,w to make the most impracticable of English Cathedrals the )st popular Church of the hugest city in the world. Pray pardon the length of this letter, and believe me, with thanks and good wishes, your faithful servant, Broke Farm, Halstead, Sevenoaks,  lOILN OAItLEY.  September, 4th, 1877.  THE LABOUR AND 0111 ER MAPRETS. ""It is,"" saps Capital and Labour, ""a peculiar fact, that leads one to doubt whether trade is really sound, that whilst the value of raw material is increasing, that of manufactured goods barely keeps stationary, and rather tends downwards than otherwise. ; , , Both raw cotton and *ool figure for an improvement,  September 8, 1877.  and not only that, but the increase in values is greater than that of quantities."" Why should this puzzle men who know all about the science of political economy? If they have a science in hand, with the principles and details of which they are as competent to deal as they profess to be, they should have no difficulty in explaining to the working men of the country a matter which, if explained, might not appear quite so puzzling or peculiar. We imagine if the employers' paper made an earnest and honest effort to understand the two puzzles contained in our extracts, it might succeed; if not to the satisfaction of the Associated Masters, whose property it is, at least to the advantage of men who prefer the truth to the promotion of any special interest. The first question we should wish to see explained is why raw material, such as cotton and wool, are rising in price, while the manufacture of these is falling ? and why labour in a parallel position, instead of rising in price like wool and cotton, has been and is falling rapidly ? and why the manufacturers who insist that reductions in the price of manufactured articles necessarily involve reductions in price of labour, do not go into the wool and cotton markets and preach the same doctrine to the sellers of these articles ?  Why should labour go down when raw material is going up And why is a reduction in the one case regarded as in accordance with the principles of political economy, and therefore absolutely natural and necessary, awl in the other case not so, its position being only slightly "" peculiar,"" and somewhat puzzling ? There must be some reason for this, and we should like to hear it stated from the "" employers' point of view."" The employers would never think of saying to a wool merchant or a cotton merchant, ""Our prices in manufactured goods are going down, and your prices for the raw material are going up most inconveniently, and must come down ; "" but they will turn to the simple-minded, puzzled workmen mid say, ""There has been a fall in the price of our goods, and we must have a reduction in your wages to compensate us."" Why does the same science deal so differently with two classes of persons placed in a like position? The ready reply is that there is no likeness in the position. This, however, is not correct. The two articles—raw material and labour—go in conresponding quantities into the production of the same manufactures, and when there is slackness of demand and cloolonaimi of price in one commodity, there ought to be slackness of demand and declension of price in the other; and when there is briskness and advance in one, there ought to be briskness and advance in the other, always excepting special circumstances which may exceptionally influence the one or the other.  What the working man should know in this matter is, that the words ""demand and supply,"" as ordinarily used, do not explain the situation; and yet ""demand and supply,"" rightly understood and applied, do explain it. There are in reality three markets, not one market. And the operation of demand and supply in each of these is distinct, and should be considered by itself before a right explanation can be given. First, there is the market for raw material, and this depends on amount of crop, on, we may say, a season's or a year's produce; and this is not capable of sudden or indefinite increase. Raw material is usually hold in largo quantities, and in comparatively few hands; and as a rule those who hold it have a power of playing with the market speculatively, keeping it back for a rise, especially when the prospects of trade are favourable. In a season of brisk demand the manufacturers are in the hands of the holders of raw material, and at all seasons the holders of this material operate only with regard to activity of demand in regulating price—they deal simply with the demands of the customers who come to them to buy, and do not care or enquire how profits stand in the market for manufactured goods,  The manufacturers act front reasons of their own. They possess a large producing power which costs much even to stand idle, and which, therefore must, if possible, be kept in motion however slight the profit, during seasons of slack trade. Besides, each manufacturer not only desires to retain his usual customers but to fully employ his productive resources by forcing sales wherever he can by cheapness. In this way production is kept up in declining markets, and raw material and labour remain in request when manufactured goods are barely remunerative, and hence there is frequently no necessity to reduce the price of either the raw "

THE unruly debate on the Irish Sunday Closing Bill in the House of Commons deserves special notice, as it embodies what is a clear abuse of the rules of Parliament.  The Irish Sunday Closing Bill has been accepted in principle by large majorities both of the Irish members and of the whole I-lour. It is open to those who oppose it to introduce amendments, and some suggested by the Government involve very important alterations. But when the House went into Committee op Monday, Mr. Murphy, an Irish member, immediately moved that the chairman do leave the chair, and supported his absurd proposal in a speech of two hours and a half, entering at length into the principle of the Bill. Mr. Onslow followed in a speech almost as long, and Mr. O'Sullivan succeeded. These three orations were evidently made merely for the purpose of obstruction, as they lasted for nearly five hours and a half, and the same object was sought by repeated attempts at a ""countput."" The novelty of the situation was that this time the minority was not exclusively Irish; in fact it was composed, in the main, of English members, while the frustrated majority had for snpporters Mr. Biggar, Mr. Parnell, Mr. O'Donnell, and other eminent Obstructionists, who were ""hoist -with their own petard,"" and forced to recognise that more than one can play at the game of pertinacious resistance. There were, however, excited Irishmen on both sides of the fray, and it must have been an edifying sight to see the Home Rulers, and even their subspction, the Obstructionists, divided among themselves. Major O'Gorman and Mr. P. j. Smyth resolutely divided, against their compatriots, and carrying with them not quite a dozen Irish members, found help from a compact band of English representa, "

Dr. Abbot has hoen these, and with grave anxiety he boa proscribed a long lie& voyage, thorough change, and rest front every eare,  as Mrs. Gunsley's best and only chance of recovery. He has told her so. But to leave her husband, to ' leave her darling children, how can she do it ? Many bidden tears, umseen by anyone, even during the children's half-hour, have fallen among the fleecy wraps. To leave all her dear ones, perhaps to die far away from them ! Mrs. Gunsley knew she might not live to return. There was hope that the voyage might work a cure. A hope—not a certainty. Pr. Abbott is never known to deceive his patients; he had tot!' Mrs. Gunsley what he believed to be the hest course for her, and sir holiet cd him. So did her husband. and Mr. Guns ey had only been waiting from week to week till some troublesome. long-delayed law business dlould be settled. to take active steps in the matter Pis wife gmat be, for a time. separated from her children; there was no help for that, but, once freed from this anxiety, he would go with her wherever she might he sent. ""When once the case is concluded. I will take her to the South Pecific,"" he had said to himself. ""We will cruise  among the islands, and stay for a while at Samoa, the finest climate in the world. pehaps we will go on to New Zealand, and, if it suits Amy, and there is any doubt that it might not be well for her to return home, I may even send for the children and settle there. A most unselfish thought, for Mr. Gundey thoroughly English to the very backbone, and of his own inclination would not exchange the sight of his own English fireside for the most beautiful scenery or finest climate in the world. The tedious lawsuit is ended, but the anxiety has not ended with it. A 6 the door of the small drawingroom opens, Baby tumbles forward with a glad cry, with all his weight crushing poor. patient Phcebe's face quite flat, and struggles to reach his father. Mr. Gunsley stoops over the sofa and kisses his wife in silence.  ""You have had a cold drive, dear,"" she says. He takes her hand fondly 112 his. 'The case is settled, Amy."" How the thin fingers twine lovingly round his own. ""It has gone against us, dear wife! I hardly thought it could. The right of the matter seemed so very plain. But the judge held a different view, legally, I cannot, dare not, say that he was wrong. The decision entirely hung upon that missing deed, for which such strict search has been made—depended upon whether that still exists. That my grandfather should have destroyed it is most improbable. I should have said impossible if he had been a different kind of man. But with all my endeavours I could not produce the deed."" "" Was the search that Lady Grey allowed at Upton Manor thoroughly carried out, do you think, Seth?"" asked Mrs. Gunsley, rising on her pillows. ""Baby, darling, if you hold poor old Phcebe over the fender close to the fire like that she will melt !"" "" The search was thorough,"" replied her husband, coming to the rescue, and picking up Baby, Phcebe and all. It was as strict a search as could be made, but, as you have heard, dear; much of the furniture was sold when the old place changed owners, and Walford and Watts are of opinion that the deed may have been accidentally carried away with it, and thus lost or destroyed. No! Further search would be useless. The case is over, Amy."" We have not lost all, dear! Indeed, I feel I have lost very little while I have you and the children."" Mr. Gunsley vvas silent. This lawsuit had made him a much pourer man. How hard to think of these dear ones leaving their pretty home—how hard to picture them in a small mean house, without their gardens, without servants—Mr. Gunsley cannot restrain a sigh. But he checks himself. Perhaps a way may yet be found out of it all. Of one way his wife's brother Jack has, even before the case was concluded, given him a hint. But everything is uncertain yet, every path seems full of difficulty. One thing only is clear —the children's Christmas must not be spoiled. Separation or poverty may be near at hand, but at least their last Christmas at Stanmore Lodge shall be a happy one. Baby jams Phoebe's silk-and-rubber face against his father's to kiss him. Catching sight of the queer patch, Mr. Gunsley laughs outright. "" Who did that ? Nursey 1 Well, nursey is a genius ! I bought the Christmas presents to-day, Amy,"" he goes on in a lighter tone. How I wished you had been with me, dear !"" . Mrs. Gunsley subsides on her pillow within answering smile. "" Jack went with me, and helped me choose. Indeed, I think most of the 'pieces of string' were his choice, and ho added to them considerably. But for him, Santa Claus would not have brought much this Christmas. Jack has been speaking again of that Australian plan, but we have agreed to let everything stand over for a week or two. I must have time to think. For a few days we will try to keep troublesome thoughts in check, dear, as much as we can, for Christmas' sake. I—""  Mr. Gunsley is interrupted. It isn't a whirlwind. It is Whiffles, followed by Seth. Both twins rush at their father. . .  ""Oh papa! papa! Self and me didn't know you were home! And we've had some more lovely, lovely cards! and Se ff did know his four times eight, and I nearly 'membered my ' jogglefry ;' I only said Lostalasia when I meant 'Merrika, and, papa, I upsetted all the ink—"" Well stops with a little gasp for breath. ""And Miss Dunn wasn't a bit cross,"" puts in Seth. "" Nursey was, and the soar went into Weir's eyes di eadful."" ""And. oh!"" cried the twins together, as Whiffles recovered herself, ""did you see Santy Claus ? Are the shops at Hartfield full and full of pieces of string ?'• Seth has climbed to his favourite place among the furs at the foot of mamma's sofa. Whiffles wriggles up on to her father's lee—he can make room for three, Plwebe included. Well doesn't wait for an answer to her questions. She very seldom does. ""Oh, papa!"" she cries, settling herself comfortably, "" Santa Claus piece of string is a most interesting book ! She read me some more of it to-day, because I was an imbleed. It is all about stories of finding most lovely, lovely things. And, papa, I want you to write a letter for me, and put it up the nursery chimney."" "" Up the chimney? What a queer place! Why, Well, what is that for ?""  ""It must go up the chimney, 'cane it's to Santy Claus,"" explains Weff, ""and I want you to write this: _  "" 'Dear Mr. Santy Claus,—Please don't forget me and Seff, and Edie, and Ronald, and everybody; and, please, if you don't mind, I should like to find a treasure tome.' "" .  Mr. Guns ley laughed. But he wrote the letter all the same, and IKhittes had the satisfaction of seeing it safely posted in the nursery chimney before she went to bed.  CHAPTER IV.  AUNT ABIGAIL  Two of the earliest Christmas cards, the angel and the bells, had been sent by the children's great-aunt Miss Abigail Gunsley, and, strange to say, had come from the old Manor house of Upton, of which by some curious turns of the wheel of fate, the old lady is once more an_intnate. _ .  ..... Abigail Gunsley had left the home of her fathers a little child of three; four years ago she returned to it. a woman of 66. To Whiffles and Seth Aunt Abigail is little more than a name. They know it is from her that Edith gets her second name. They have heard their father speak of her, and they have a vague sort of notion that Ronald has somehow offended the old lady, because his name was not Seth; when, as the eldest son, it should have been. Very unfair this, if true, for none of us have power 1.1 choose our own names, we have to take those that .. • given to us, and make the beat of them. The . were sent to Seth, the angel to Edith, none at all • , Ronald and Weff. But Ronald is not as keen after pretty cards as the little ones are, and Edith gave Weff the angel, $0 it did not matter much. Ronald has a dim recollection of a very tall, dark lady, with iron-gray hair, who rather frightened him. sturdy child as he was, during a short visit site mud to Stanmore Lodge five years ago. He remembers that he was not allowed to ride his rocking-horse during her stay, because of the ""bumping"" noise it made, and remembers how, long after the visitor had cone, nurse would say to him when he was naughty: ""What do you think you Aunt Abigail would say to that, sir l"" . . .  Ronald has quite given up the reeking-horse now, ever since he had Prince Charlie. The twins look upon it as their property, and generally ride it together, taking turns who shall be on its hack and vlio underneath, or behind, holding on to its tail. And there being no Aunt Abigal to object, Lump about the playroom to their hearts' content. Edith doesn't remember much of Aunt Abigail, she has us clearer recollection of her maid—Brooke—apd of the pretty little silky lapdog—Miss Abigail's constant companion. bfanana dons pot often talk about Miss Gunsley, but the chiklren know he writes to her sometimes, and they know too, that Edith's and Beth's birthdays are always honoured by an Aunt Abigail ""plane of string."" .  Nurse and Susan have a very clear recollection of the old lady indeed, though her visit was only a short one. arid in momenta of confidence they have been known to refer to her as ""a caution."" Uncle Jack has only seen her once, and if you had his genuine opinion you might find it the same Morris refers to her as ""a oner, and no mistake."" Which. considering how often, her dog trotting at her heels, or carried by Brooke, she ""rotated up"" Morris during her stay. interfering with his management of the horses, the stable, the loft, the garden, the shrubbery, and everything else, is not surprising. For many years Miss Gunsley had been her brother's constant companion. When he married she spent her time going from place to place, staying sometimes near the sea, then, tired of it, spending some months inland, always with Brooke—who has been her constant attend4nt since they were young women together—and generally with a dog. Since her return to Upton her letters seem to say that she is, or fancies herself to be, an invalid. Having not so much to amuse her, and less change in the quiet of the Manor House, she has taken to the study of her own health; arid her nephew, Mr. Gunsley, has no doubt she does that as energetically as everything else. Ho has much affection for Aunt She was very kind to him when he was a boy. (To be continued.) "

FROM "" MA.P.""  This is one of the reseons why I read everything I find in the newspapers about the new Pope. There is another reason. Somehow or other, the whole world has grasped the fact that the new Pope bars something that is so human, 60 brotherly, so simple in his character, that he is kin with the whole world —with those of another as well as with those of his own faith. Simplicity, gorN-1 -ss of heart, perity of conduct, always tell with the wcrrld, and these seem to be the dominating characteristics of Pius X. All I have read since his elevation to his sublime position confirms this estimate of his character. There are certain things in his acts which have almost a pathetic simplicity. When the Conclave was about to meet somebody asked Cardinal Sart°, as he then was, whether he knew French. lle replied that he did not know a word of any language but his ow-n; whereupon his interloctor exclaimed, ""Then you cannot be elected Pope."" ""Thank God,"" replied the simple priest, with great unction. And it may be rememlaered that when it became evident that votes were concentrating on him from the great rivals that were first in the running, Cardinal Sarto was seized with a panic, and gave his ignorance of French and of the ways as well of the _language of courtly and diplomatic, society as unanswerable grounds against his elevation to the position of one of the great powers of the earth. The family of the Pope have Joist none of their native simplicity here at Riese. The Pope's sister, Signora Teresa Parolin, has eight children, the daughters assisting, as formerly, at the little inn, and the sods serving in the little general shop next door. On the other aide is the house where Pius X. wat born, as fresh as whitewash can make it, with a brand-new tablet recording the happy event. The Parolin household are very ready to speak of their great relative, the only way in which they seem to realise his new position being that they all desire to go to Rome in the idea the 4 he could procure this pleasure for them. The late-Pope was an aristocrat by birth, and he had a mighty intelligence and a powerful will that drew people towards him by sheer force of superiority, but there was always a certain awe commingled with the admire. tion. In this way he powerfully impressed the imagination of Europe. The present Pontiff will probably in time have as great a position, but it will be by. the sheer force of sweetness and gentleness and simplicity. "

ACCIDENT TO A PIECED AT SPRINOREAD. An alarming accident happened at the Springhead Spinning Company's mill to a little placer named Herbert E. Platt, at noon on Saturday. It seems that the machinery had been stopped for a time for cleaning purposes, when about ten minutes to one o'clock, the minder, William Wooley, being unaware that the lad was still unemployed in cleaning the roller beam, set the mule in motion. The consequence was that the lad was caught between the carriage and the beam in question, and appeared to be seriously injured. A medical man was sent for, who, on his arrival, expressed an opinion that no bones were broken. The sufferer was, however, bruised about the stomach and back, and was taken home in a cab.  FATAL ACCIDENT.—The sad news of the death of Buckley Bowers, firebeater at the Stamford Spinning Company, under such speially sorrowful surroundings, caused the utmost surprise and regret when the news became generally known. He had been to Oldham on some errand, and was returning to the mill, and, on reaching New Earth Railway Bridge, got upon the line of railway to walk, as he thought, more directly and expeditiously to the mill. He was in company with two railway servants, and, on nearing Wellihole Bridge, a couple of passing trains caused him to be caught by the top step of one of the engines, and be received such serious injuries as culmirrated fatally before he could be got to the Oldham Infirmary. He has left a widow and five young children. The directors of the mill acted very feelingly toward the sorrowful family, and the result of a subscription amongst themselves and their manager enabled the sum of £6 to be sent to them. Deceased was interred at Lees Cemetery on Wednesday afternoon. MINDERS MONTHLY MEETING. —On Tuesday evening the monthly meeting of the Operative Cotton Spinners' Association (Lees branch), was held in the Assembly Room at the Angel Inn. There was a very good meeting of members and officials. The president was in the chair. The report read was of a very assuring and encouraging character. The restart of work at the Oldham and Lees Mill has lessened the number on the books who were receiving stoppage pay. The report and minutes were passed unanimously, as was also the report presented by the representative on the Provincial Council. A prospectus was submitted from an Oldham newspaper relative to the contemplated conversion and establishment into a company of a new newspaper to be devoted to the advocacy of workers and operatives in general, not specially cotton workers, but those employed in other grades throughout the borough and district. The prospectus asked for the support of the various associations. The matter was very freely talked over and discussed. The general feeling seemed to be that it was best to let well alone, and continue their loyalty to the Cotton Factory Times, which had advocated their cause in a most fair and comprehensive manner. A motion was made that no action be taken in the matter beyond acknowledging baying received the same. "

About 500 men employed at the Midland Ironworks, Rotherham, will be in a state of enforced idleness for the next two or three weeks owing to the breaking down of the large forging engine.  THE SUICIDE IN A SALFORD POLICE CELL.-011 Monday morning Mr. F. Price held an inquest to inquire into the circumstances connected with the death of Walter Armstrong, who committed suicide in a police cell at the Salford Town Hall on Friday night. The jury returned a verdict that deceased committed suicide while of unsound mind, and they added that his insanity was induced by excessive drinking. DISGRACEFUL OUTRIGE.—A disgraceful outrage, arising, it is said, out of the anti-tithe agitation, has been perpetrated at Whitcharch, Pembrokeshire. A party of men, with tar barrels and brushes, proceeded in the dead of the night to the parish church, and bedaubed the walls with tar, some of the windows of the sacred edifice—a new and very handsome specimen of ecclesiastical architecture—being also broken.  SITICIDE.—The Rev. John Lloyd Jones, MA., committed suicide at Aberayron on Saturday. Having purchased half an ounce of strychnine from a chemist for the purpose, as he said, of killing magpies, he went into the Victoria Hotel, called for some beer, put in the poison, and drank it. He died in twenty minutes. The deceased was 54 years of age, and for the last seven months had been stationed at Thorpe Hamlet, near Norwich. VELOCITY OE ELECTRIC/TY.—There is, as Professor Thompson remarks, no assignable ""velocity of electricity,"" as this must vary with the current and the conductor. Wheatstone. in 1833, seemed to show a transmission velocity of 183,000 miles a second through copper wire, but in late experiments signals were sent over ordinary telegraph wires on poles and had a rate of only 14,000 to 16,000 miles. With wires near the earth the velocity was 12,000 miles, but reached 24,000 on very high wires.  THE PnkintNi MUSSEL—At the auction of effects belonging to Marie Regnault, who was murdered by Pranzini, a bundle of old clothes with some trashy curiosities were knocked down to a rag and bone woman. In the lot was a bustle, in ripping up which the purchaser found the £4OO worth of debentures which it was known Marie Regnault had in her possession, but which, not being found after she was murdered, were a cause of perplexity to the prosecution and the jury. The woman took her find to the Prefecture of Police.  SUBSTITUTES FOR COPPEB.—The Statist has an article on copper, and examines whether it is possible to curtail the use of copper. Its conclusion is that substitutes can be used on a very large scale. For instance, the brass and copper used on a locomotive engine have hitherto been about si tons, but by substituting iron and steel in various parts of the engine, 4i tons out of the 6,1 e tons at present generally used can be replaced. A large quantity of copper is also used in the brass furniture and fittings of houses, ships, carriages, B:c., and here again economies in the consumption of the highpriced metal are practicable.  A Craious EXPERTMENT.—The power of imagination is supposed to be stronger in women than in men; but this was not shown in a recent hospital experiment. Dr. Durand, it is stated, wishing to test the practical effect of mind diseases, gave 100 patients a dose of sweetened water. Fifteen minutes after, entering apparently in great excitement, he announced that he had by a mistake given a powerful emetic, and preparations must be made accordingly. Eighty out of the one hundred patients became thoroughly ill, and exhibited the usual results of an emetic; twenty were unaffected. The curious part of it is that, with very few exceptions, the eighty ""emetized"" subjects were men, while the strong-minded few, who were not to be caught with chaff, were women. FIGHT WITH A BEAR IN Lo.—For some time past Mr. Miller, carman and contractor, of Durhamrow, Ratcliffe, London, has been keeping a fine fully-grown brown bear in the rear of his premises. A few days since Mr. Miller saw the huge beast, which had evidently burst the fastenings of his den, about to leave it. With great presence of mind he rushed forward and tried to force Bruin back into his den; but the animal refused to go, and endeavoured to push his way out. The struggle between the two lasted some time, until a gun was borrowed from a gentleman living in Bromley-street. Mr. Miller then fired at the bear, and the bullet entered the centre of the skull and proved fatal. The animal was then skinned, and afterwards exhibited to an admiring crowd. A DESTRIICTIVE FLUID. Dr. Junernann, an Austrian chemist, claims to have invented a fluid of most destructive properties. This fluid when brought into contact with the air, after the explosion of a shell in which it has been contained, is transformed into a gas, which, being heavier than the air, descends to the ground, killing all men and animals within its reach, and moreover destroying iron, bronze, and other metals, as well as setting all inflammable things on fire. So at least the inventor declares in a letter published in one of the Vienna newspapers, and he adds that as far back as 1848 he offered his invention to the Austrian War Office, which, however, declined both then and on a subsequent occasion to make experiments. For this reason he now gives publicity to his invention, as his patriotic feelings do not allow him to reveal his secret to foreign Governments.  A Divorces Pao.—"" All Paris"" is laughing heartily over the misadventure which has just befallen a bonne bourgeoiJe who for some mysterious reason was anxious to obtain a divorce. She had a model husband—indeed, he was such a pattern of domestic virtue that, unable to find a pretext, she herself put temptation in his way. A young and comely damsel was bribed by the wife to visit her one day and make eyes at the worthy man. As the trio were sitting together, the matron got up and left the room on business of an important character. The decoy-bird played her part so well that the husband was soon enticed into a flirtation, and then the outraged wife appeared on the scene with a police-magistrate and a score of her female friends. Unluckily, however, for the plaintiff in this curious divorce suit, the details of the plot leaked out. The court got wind of the affair, and at the trial the lady's tactics were so thoroughly exposed that her intended victim was triumphantly acquitted, and she herself left the hall amid the jeers and taunts of the spectators.  THE PROGRESS or FR- lENDLY SOOIET/ES. - The statistics of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows, the wealthiest, and of the Ancient Order of Foresters, numerically the largest friendly society in the world, have just been completed for the past year—the foimer by Mr. T. Collins, and the latter by Mr. S. Shawcross, the secretaries of the respective Orders. On the Ist January, 1888, the Manchester Unity numbered 627,594 financial members, a net increase of 10,007 daring last year. There were altogether 39,994 persons initiated into the Order, 37,652 in Great Britain, and 2,342 in the colonies; but 22,418 had left the Unity or been suspended, and the deaths had numbered 7,569. The Ancient Order of Foresters, on the Ist of January, 1888, numbered 686,127, and 16,429 honorary members, showing an increase during last year of 18,55'7 benefit and 777 honorary members. There were altogether 56.845 benefit members initiated during 1887; but the deaths numbered 6,890, and 30,680 had from various causes left the Order. The Juvenile Foresters' Society numbers 72,377 members, with £86,542 capital, an increase during the year of 4,874 members and of £7,323 in funds. The A.M.C., or annual Parliament of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows, will this year be held at Gloucester during Whit-week; and the High Court of the Foresters will be held in August, at Reading, where the High Court is now located.  According to intelligence by mail, no fewer than 15,000 persons perished in a recent earthquake in the Yetnan district of China, 5,000 of these in the capital alone. Dr. Emil Bessels, the Arctic explorer, who acted as doctor on board the A,merican ship Polaris, under Hall, in 1871, died suddenly of apoplexy, at Stuttgart, on Friday, at the age of 40. The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Joarnal says' that the ""harmless necessary cat "" contributed no fewer than 4,542 skins to the fur sales just concluded, being 1,000 more than were sold in March last year. - •  . The coldest spot on earth is Werchojanak, in Siberia. The mean temperature for the year 1885 was 2.9 deg. Fahrenheit below zero. For January and December it was 62.9 deg. below, and for July it rose to 60.5 deg. above zero. Talking of the future, the New Orleans Picayune thus remarks: Marion Harland says the coming woman will have her own bank account. She needs to have it if she expects to support the coming man who will be her husband.  Barnum has become a landed proprietor. An enormous estate which he has purchosed in Bridgeport, Connecticut, includes land on which are five churches, six livery stables, three bank buildings, and more than 100 private dwellings. It is worth $6,000,000. The new Russian stamp duty does not impose any increased taxation on any new securities which may issued. The stamp duty on securities bearing a fixed rate of interest is raised, and it is clearly decided who is to pay the duty—a point hitherto disputed. By the burning of a barn and granary at Long Marston. near York, on Tuesday morning, a man unknown was burnt to death. Three cows and a calf were also destroyed by the flames, which are supposed to have been accidentally caused by the man who lost his life.  On Tuesday morning the York coroner held an inquest on the body of a child which was found dean near York on Sunday morning. Two youths noticed the head and arm protruding from the ground in a field, and dug the body up. It was wrapped in brown paper, and tied with string, and had evidently been buried about two months. The jury returned an open verdict. The Manchester magistrates are driven to take strong measures against "" scatters."" At the Police Court, on Tuesday, a youth named Ladley was sentenced to two months' imprisonment, with hard labour, for assaulting a man named Percival. Tho prosecutor was attacked by a gang of roughs in the street, and so badly beaten with belts that his life was for some time despaired of.  ROBBERY BY THE ""CONFIDENCE"" TRICIC.-At Birmingham Police Court, on Tuesday, Jos. Hughes, Manchester, and George Gray, Salford, were committed for trial charged with robbing Samuel Hatfield of £154. In November last the accused enticed the prosecutor into a coffee-house by the ""confidence trick,- and when there robbed him of his money by violent means. Upon the accused a number of flash bank notes were found and title deeds.  Flames broke out early on Tuesday morning at a private house in Cressingham-road, Lewisham, Kent. Fire engines arrived, but there was a delay of ten minutes in obtaining water, during which time the firemen stood and watched the house burn. The rooms and contents were almost destroyed. There were two fires at tobacconists' shops in London on Tuesday—one at 2, Brornptonroad, and the other 309, Kennington-road—causing much damage. Tiara Hmunic. A Calcutta correspondent writes: ""The Duo d'Orleans preferred to remain with his shooting party instead of joining the Sikkim field force. He has enjoyed good sport, having bagged 16 tigers, besides a large amount of other game, He recently had a narrow escape. A tigress charged his elephant, and succeeded in climbing into the howdah, which, with some guns, she completely smashed. Ultimately the howdah gave way, and the tigress fell to the ground. The telegram unaccountably omits to state what became of the Duke.""  A FORTUNE IN A FILTER.—A Paris correspondent writes: Last December the State came into a large fortune which was left it by an old man named Meyer, who said in his will that he had no relatives. When the inventory of Meyer's goods and chattels was being made a stone filter was thrown aside because broken and unfit for any use; but the other day, when it was being carried away as rubbish, a bundle of papers fell out. On examination they were found to be debentures and other stock, payable to bearer, and, at the present state of the stock market, worth 42,000.  THE TYPOGRAPHICAL Associartm—This organisation, which still has its headquarters in Manchester, has recently issued its seventy-seventh half-yearly report. The roll of members was increased in 1887 by 439, and now stands at 7,498. Notwithstanding heavy expenditure to unemplo3,ed members, the general fund has increased by £1,141 Bs., and is now stated at £12,929 l6s. 7d., while that specially set apart for making provision for superannuated members has reached £6,358 6s. Bd., being an increase of £99 2s. 4d. during the past six months. EXTRAORDINARY ACCIDENT IN SURREY.-0/1. Monday a distressing fatality occurred at Upper Cater. hem. A party consisting of Mr. Bart, picture frame maker, Croydon, his wife, his son, aged 12, and his niece, aged 18, were driving home through Upper Caterha.m when they came to a very large pond, and Mr. Burt let the horse go towards the pond for a drink. The bank at the spot is very steep, and a man, seeing their danger, shouted to them, but it was too late. The horse slid down the bank, pulling the vehicle and its occupants into 20 feet of water. Mrs. Burt and her son at once sank, and were drowned. Mr. Burt and his niece were rescued in an exhausted state, and the latter was for some time unconscious.  PAYMENT OF LABOER REPRESENTATIVES. - The question of the continuation of the salaries of Messrs. Burt and Fenwick, the Parliamentary representatives of the miners of Northumberland will be settled in a few days. It is stated that at some of the colliery villages many of the miners were so annoyed at the last vote not being taken as final that they resolved to leave the union, and the consequence will be that these disaffected ones will not be able to vote this time. On the other hand, at other collieries a great change has taken place. Many of the men who were the most opposed to the salaries being paid are now inclined to vote for the continuance of the existing system. Voting has already been taken at some places, and it is expected that the whole of the ballot papers will be sent to the office-of the officials in Newcastle in the psesent week. At Seaton Burn Colliery 61 voted in favour of the salaries and 104 against, or a majority of 43 against.  M. PLIMSOLL AND THE MINERS.-WTitillg in reference to the fund being raised towards defraying the damages and costs in which Mr. Pickard, M.P., was recently mulcted at the Yorkshire Assizes, in an action for libel, Mr. Samuel Plimsoll, ex-M.P. for Derby, says :—"" I remember the time, years ago now, when I had received notices of 12 actions for libel—three of which were in full swing in the courts, and which were, no doubt, intended to ruin me. At that time of anxiety the working men came to my aid with wonderful liberality, and the colliers with what may truly be called munificence, especially when it is borne in mind that every shilling they contributed represented from an hour to an hour and a half's downright hard labour. I beg your acceptance of the enclosed cheque for £2OO. I also enclose a second cheque for £2OO, to be used either wholly or in part, in case your subscriptions should fall short of the needs of the case. The colliers stood by me in the hour of need, and I wish to stand by them now in the person of their working representative, Mr. Pickard. They are noble fellows, the colliers—a full third of them at this moment are uncomplainingly supporting aged parents or orphaned brothers and sisters, as would be proved again next week in case of the occurrence of an explosion."" ""A HORSE OF AN INVENTIVE TERN.""—A correspondent writes to the Globe as follows :—Until last summer I had a mare, which, though English, was almost as clever as the American horse mentioned in your issue of yesterday. In the stable in which she was there is a shoot connected with a large corn-bin in the loft above, and in this shoot there are two metal horizontal slides. On pulling out the upper elide, a feed of oats would fall into the space comprised between the two slides, and on pulling out the lower slide after closing the upper slide, this feed would fall into anything held to receive it, or on to the floor of the stable. The mare had evidently noticed this arrangement, for during the last few years of her life, when, no doubt, her intelligence was at its prime (I had had her seventeen years, and she was shot at twenty-four), she occasionally contrived to free herself from her halter in the night, pulled out both sides (one would not have been enough) and helped herself to the two feeds which were generally kept in the shoot, for she did not close the upper slide before opening the lower one, and so got at the corn which was in the shoot. When she had finished her oats, she turned on the water tap and obtained what water she wanted. But, unlike the American horse, she did not turn the tap back again, neither did she pub back the slides.  It has been noticed as a curious fact that the majority of the great chess champions are men of small stature.  A supposed wax figure, which was on exhibition at Youngstown, Ohio, has turned out to be a live young woman.  All the writings left by the Emperor William are to be collected and arranged. This by command of the Emperor Frederick.  A FILTHY HOUSE.—The sanitary inspector of the Yeovil Union has just lit upon an agreeable retreat occupied by one Susan Wellman. Two donkeys were found upon the ground floor of the house. hi another room of the same floor several ducks and other fowls were cooped up in a very filthy condi. tion. Upstairs, again, in a bedroom were still more fowls, kept upon heaps of rubbish and dirty clothes. The Guardians have naturally expressed their abhorence of such a state of things, and have taken steps to remedy the nuisance. This must ba satisfactory for the neighbours, at all events.  SUICIDE OF COUNT VICTOR KAROLYL—The suicide of Count Victor Karolyi engrosses public attention in Peeth. He was one of the wealthiest Hungarian maguntes, aged 49, and the eldest son of Count Karolyi, the Hungarian Chamberlain, who died in 1887. He was. a stranger to public life. Official telegrams ascribe the suicide to sudden insanity, but according to private information a love affair was the real cause. He blew his brains out with a revolver at his chateau. He was first cousin to the Ambassador in London. A LABOUR REPRESENTATIVE FOR SCOTLAND. MT. Threlfall, secretary to the Labour Electoral Corn. mittee of the Trades Union Congress left on Tuesday for Glasgow to further the candidature of Mr. J. Keir-Hardie, labour candidate for Mid-Lanarkshire. Mr. Threlfall has issued a declaration on the part of the labour party stating that, as this is the first attempt to secure for Scotland a repre. sentative of labour, it is practically a test question 11d5 to bow far the professed attachment of the Liberal party for labour representation is a reality. A SHIPLOAD or BRIDES.—The French Government display a great activity in getting their colonies populated. They lately issued an flavor. tisement to the following effect :—"" Wanted, for an island lying in the vicinity of Numea, which is peopled by French emigran a, 100 young women who wish to enter into the state of matrimony."" The inducements set forth were that intended brides should not only be provided with a free passage, but receive from the Government a "" dot "" of 109 francs each. In a very short time—as may readily be supposed—the 100 requisite young women were found, and a ship was chartered to convey them to their destination. This curious shipload was composed for the most part of highly respectable girls, including amongst them representatives of almost every trade teachers, dressmakers, milliners, cooks, barmaids, laundresses, &c., all figure 014 the list. IDENTIFICATION BY MEANS or A. CARRIER PIGEON.— Early on Friday morning, as a tramcar was going . . . _  along' Rensha-street, Liverpool, a working-ma:l who was riding outside was taken suddenly ill, and died in a few minutes. He had with him at tlie time a basket containing two pigeons. As there was nothing to show his identity, his body IIT3 taken to the Royal Infirmary, and the pigeons were removed to the detective office, Dale-street. In tha course of s short time one of the pigeons was allowed to fly away with a note tied round one of its legs requesting the people to whom it went to communicate with the Detective Department, as the person who had been carrying the bird had been taken suddenly ill, and had subsequently died. The pigeon went straight home, and in the course of the day William Henry Eves called at the detective office, and identified the body as. that of  his father, Jain Eves, who resided at. 9 house, 3 court, Southwell-street, Tosteth Park, Liverpool. M. PASTEUR AND BABIES.-31. Pasteur is treating a very serious case of rabies at Paris in the person of Mr. W. C. Chamberlain, a . wealthy ranchnian from Texas. The patient was bitten in the face by a mad wolf on the night of March 9th, while sleeping in an encampment. He burnt the wound, and travelled 120 miles to Dr. Spohn, of Corpus Christi, who after a brief treatment brought him to Paris. M. Pasteur is hopeful, although he says the delay has increased the danger. Dr. Spohn says that Mr. Chamberlain showed some nervous symptoms not unlike incipient hydrophabia during the journey. He refused to drink or look at water, and once asked the doctor to handcuff or tie him. M. Pasteur considers this case for rapid intensive treatment to lessen the chances of rabies declaring itself after a short incubation of 30 days. Ho considers that there is no difference between wolf and canine rabies. He sums up the Chamberlain case by saying that if the incubation lasts 50 or 60 days he has every hope of a cure. If, however, a speedier outbreak is at hand the prospects are not so beering.  A WARW/CKSIIIRE MISER: EXTRAORDINARY RENT. maims. Dr. life, the North Warwickshire coroner, held an inquest on Monday, at Foleshill, on the body of Isaac Cadman, aged 71, who had been found dead in a cottage in which he had lived for some time alone. Deceased, who had been accustomed to travel with a threshing machine, had not been seen for some days, and on his house being broken into he was found lying on a small bedstead in an almost, naked condition. His body was lying upon some dirty rags, notwithstanding that he had plenty of clothing. The cottage con. tamed only a few articles of furniture, but in a chest of drawers the police discovered nearly £23 10s. in money, and some title deeds relating to the house in which he lived. Dr. Orton said de. ceased was of very penurious habits, and had been accustomed to beg from anybody he met. He had been twice an inmate of the workhouse, but did not remain there long. He was a miser in every sense of the word, and had often been relieved by poor people who believed he was in needy circumstances. Plenty of coal was found in his house, but notwith. standing the severity of the weather recently, and the fact that his house was in a dilapidated con. dition, there was no evidence that he had had a fire for some time past. In his opinion death ensued from congestion, caused by exposure. The Coroner said the case was an extraordinary one. It was evident deceased had plenty of money to make himself happy and comfortable. He had received alms from charitable people which ought to have gone to a better purpose. It was much to be regretted that when there were hundreds and thousands of poor people in different parts of the country in a state of semi-starvation, many of whom were bearing their povery without complain. log, this man could have been hoarding up his gold and begging the alms which other people stood so much in need of. There was no doubt he contributed, by worshipping money as his god, to his own death. The jury returned a verdict that deceased died from congestion of the lungs, brought about by exposure.  INHUMAN CONDUCT OF A MOTHER.-A shocking case was heard, on Saturday, in the Liverpool Coroner's Court, before Mr. Clarke Aspinall. An inquest was held on the body of Mary Henley, aged two years and four months, the child of Andrew Henley, a labourer, living in Gordon-street, Everton. For some months past the father of the deceased had been an inmate of the workhouse, suffering from a wound in his head inflicted by his wife. At the end of January the husband came out of the hospital, but for some time had not been able to obtain work. The wife obtained parish relief three weeks ago. After the father had gone home he found all the children in the cellar locked up, and the mother absent. She returned at about halfpast eight in a state of drunkenness, and said she was going to the workhouse, as she had a relieving order for herself and her children. At the time she had a baby who had been ailing for six weeks, and the husband said the child would be sure to die if it was taken out, but the wife was determined to go, and accordingly left with her children. The evidence of Elizabeth Tinnion showed that shortly be. fore nine o'clock she met the deceased walking along Walton-road with the children. At that time the woman was reeling from the effects of drink. She spoke to the woman, who told her that she had been turned out by her husband, and was going to the workhouse. The witness noticed that she carried a child in her arms, and asked to look at it. The woman said she thought it was dying, but upon examination it was found that the mother was carrying it face downwards, and that it was then in a critical state. A policeman was spoken to, and he, finding the woman was drunk, took her to the police station, the child being at the tint. dead. It was proved by one of the relieving officers of the Union that the woman had been offered relief, and also cab fare from her residence to Walton Workhouse, but had refused this.—Dr. A. Woods stated that the child was in a dangerous condition, and that the exposure resulting from taking it out had tended to accelerate death.—An open verdict was returned, and the jury said they thought the mother deserving of censure.—The Coroner did not offer any remarks, stating that he would direct the attention of the prosecuting solicitor to the matter, who would decide if any steps would be taken or not.

A great deal has been written of late concerning the damaging effect of Southern competition upon the cotton trade of the New England States of America, and allegations to this effect have been worked for all they were worth by the manufacturers in connection with the strike at Fall River. There can be no doubt that the great development of the industry in the cotton belt has had its effect upon the trade of the Northern States, but we believe the harmful effects of the competition have been sadly over-rated. The owners of mill property in the Carolinas and adjoining States certainly enjoy what advantages are to be derived from cheaper labour and longer working hours, but there is a point, not very low down, where economy on these lines becomes false, and, as a matter of fact, it is only in low grades of goods that the Southerners have so far been able to prosper. The extent of this prosperity may be gauged from the fact that in 1893 there were less than 250 cotton mills in the South, whereas last year the number had sprung up to 594—an increase of over 100 per cent. in a single decade—and reports of new ventures are constantly coming to hand. Naturally this extensive development has had its effect in the older centres of industry. Bit the question is whether the evil, if it may be so regarded, has not been greatly exaggerated. The other week we quoted a Fall River authority who expressed the opinion that, taking all things into consideration, there was but slight, if any, advantage of the one section over the other, the problem being one more of management than locality. Now we have the ""New Bedford Standard"" making a stand against this alarmist manifestation.  With respect to the hysterical suggestion that the Northern cotton mill owners would find themselves under the necessity of moving South to do business, our contemporary sensibly observes:—"" With all due and deserved respect to the prophets of gloom in the North and the seers of change in the South, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. The cotton industry has not been established in New England these many years, and has not grown to its magnificent proportions to melt away like powdered sugar in a cup of hot coffee. Here it is, and here it is going to stay under the direction of men who have faith, brains, knowledge of the business, and courage."" People who believe that the cotton industry of New England is in a bad way overlook the condition of the mills in the South, which, although they have no general strike on their hands, have had to "

From the circular issued by Mr. Marsland, the general secretary of the Spinners' Amalgamation, it appears that the vexed question of withdrawing from the Brooklands Agreement in bad spinning cases is not yet finally settled. The representatives of the Employers' Federation have suggested an amendment which apparently does not meet with the approval of the Spinners' Executive, and have further intimated that they cannot agree to any partial annulling of the Agreement, claiming that either all disputes or none must be dealt with under its provisions. Under these circumstances, the representatives at the next quarterly meeting are to be asked to consider whether the decision to with- ' draw shall be adhered to, or if power shall be given to the E.C. to negotiate for some improvement which shall be acceptable to the general body of the members. No one can blame the spinners for having made up their minds to insist upon an improvement in the quality of the spinning which has of late years been supplied at a large number of mills. Nor can anyone blame them for deciding to withdraw from the Brooklands Agreement if that is in any way responsible for their trouble. But, after all, perhaps it is as well that further consideration should be given to the matter before taking any action which would lead to the total abolition of the system of negotiation which has proved so beneficial to both employers and operatives in the general run of dispute cases. Without in any way receding from the position they have taken up with regard to having the work improved, it surely ought to be possible to arrive at some solution which would enable the representatives of both sides to promptly and effectively deal with bad spinning complaints and at the same time to preserve the admitted general advantages of the Broaklands Agreement.  Mr. Alfred Henry Gill, M.P., is the subject of one of a series of articles just published in the ""Bolton Journal"" dealing with the Parliamentary work of local M.P.'s. A tribute is paid to the useful work done in a quiet, unostentatious manner on behalf of the workers by this well-known M.P. Reference is made to his maiden speech in the House on the question of time cribbing, and also to his backing of the Old-age Pensions Bill of Mr. Lever, as well as the valuable services rendered in connection with the Workmen's Compensation Bill which has lately passed into law. Though Mr. Gill—as the article states—has given a high proportion of silent votes, his hours devoted to public duty have been many. His numerous friends in textile circles will be pleased to know that amongst his colleagues at St. Stephen's he has earned the reputation of being a good fellow all round.  We have been favoured with a description of an invention to take the place of the ""wage board and slate"" which the weavers have so much kicked against as being conducive to the driving system. The invention is all right so far as it goes, but we do not believe it will be adopted ' by employers generally. When the merits and demerits of the wage board and slate system has been under discussion certain employers have endeavoured to de. fend it by asserting that without it they could not check the workpeople's wages against the wages sliewn in the office books. We never believed in the sincerity and soundness of this excuse for maintaining the objectionable custom, well knowing that scores of firms worked this department quite smoothly without the aid of such a system. The primary object of using the slate and posting wages is the stringing up of the operatives to the utmost extent of their physical powers. ""Maximum production "" is the underlying idea of the arrangement. We are more fixed in that opinion to-day than ever. This is why we doubt the general adoption of the ""Patent Wage Recorder,"" even though the slate and wage board may be discarded. Agitation is killing the slate and wage board custom. The adoption or otherwise of a harmless wage recorder will test one of the principal excuses used for keeping it alive.  Condensed weft is evidently being extensively used in sonic mills, and is causing the operatives who have to weave it to ask questions relative to the remuneration for working the yarn. There are employers who express surprise when the operatives tell them that this class of yarn does not weave as well as the ordinary spun cotton weft. This surprise in many cases is  assumed. The employers have their tongues in their cheeks while they are painfully endeavouring to put on a look of amazement. Why daily with the question in this fashion? In the very nature of things they know this yarn does not, and will not, weave like the other, and, therefore, the best way to deal with the detect is to come to some arrangement for paying an extra rate fiir putting in the weft. The cloth, by inserting condensed weft, may be desirable, but this is no reason why the weavers should have more work and less wages in consequence of the new venture in cloth effect. The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. In like manner the test of this weft is in the weaving, and if any employer or manager is sceptical of the weavers' complaints, let him try a week on four looms with this material in them all. If employers will face the situation by deciding to acknowledge the difference and pay for it there is a career for the yarn. If not, well Fining in the Lancashire weaving industry is illegal. That is to say, the employers have no legal right whatever to deduct the smallest amount from wages for any purpose or claim whatever. Some of them do impose fines, and hear nothing further about them. That is because the operatives concerned have not sufficient pluck or resource to contest them, or because they do not care to run the risk of losing their employment in preference to suffering a small deduction from their wages. The fear of the "" sack "" enables the employer to impose with impunity many illegal and intolerable conditions. That is why we advocate that fining in any shape or form, or under any conditions, should be made an indictable offence. Devices for evading the law are numerous and ingenious. Here is one. ""Received from 1,390 one penny for damaged cloth."" That is a sample of a 'ticket given to a weaver by a firm when they had decided to deduct a penny from her wages for a slight inadvertence she had made in the weaving of a certain class of work. A weaver might have two or three of these in a week, and the firm have hundreds ready printed. It bears the impeess of a receipt for money willingly and agreeably paid by the operative, nct "" deducted "" without her full and free consent, whereas it is part of a system of fining which is as detestable as it is unjust and unreasonable. The weaver does not acquiesce any the more in this quasi-respectable method of fining because the employer is fair minded enough to give her a receipt for every penny he deducts from her wages for so-called damaged work.  A select committee of the House of Commons has recently be gathering evidence bearing upon the question of"" home work' in a variety of trades. In the facts that have come to light it is shown that children are employed in the Nottingham lace trade at the very tender age of from four to six years. A girl seven years of age was said to be called out of bed to commence work at 6 a.m., and after breakfast, consisting of bread and jam, was sent to school. Her dinner consisted of a halfpennyworth of fried fish and a halfpennyworth of pickles. After school hours in the evening her work at home was resumed. Bed was reached at is p.m., and the following day the same round of duty awaited her. Of course, an Englishman's home is his castle, and consequently such deplorable circumstances as these do not come within the province of the Government inspector of factories. Doubtless the majority of the inhabitants of Nottingham would be shocked to learn that such conditions existed in their midst. Indignation will be but a mild term to express the feelings of many Lancashire operative cotton spinners on hearing that yarn spun under the best trade union conditions is afterwards manipulated in homes such as the one referred to, inflicting untold misery on these unprotected children. No wonder we hear so much about the abolition of ""home work."" If this is a sample, the sooner it is made illegal and the better it will be for all concerned.  To those not acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of the case it may seem strange, that weavers who are injured while giving assistance to overlookers in the lifting of beams, &c., should demand full wages during incapacity, and the payment of their doctor's bill. The claim, however, is modest and reasonable. It is not the weaver's work, and they do not want it at any price. In this work the overlookers should assist each other, and in very many cases they do so. In taking on this beam lifting, in addition to the duties of weaving, the weavers run two risks of meeting with an accident to other people one. So far we know the overlookers, as an organised body, approve of this work being confined to the men in their trade, and it is also the opinion of organised employers, that the lilting of beatns belongs to the duties covered by overlooking. Therefore it seems that all parties are agreed, and there need be no cause for friction. It is only in isolated instances that misunderstandings occur.

Labour at Eccles On Monday evening, under the auspices of the Eceles Co-op. Women's Guild, Mrs. Child, of Bolton, gave an interesting address on ""Child Labour"" in the Co-op. Hall, Peel-street, Eccles. Mrs. Price, who presided, opened the proceedings by pointing out the inhuman conditions under which children of tender years were compelled to work eprly in the last century. In the pits and in the mills children of 9,10, and 11 years were compelled to work 12 and 14 hours per day. Could they wonder, then, that those who survived such a wretched state of things should grow up for the most part poor, stunted specimens of humanity, and that their moral condition should be on a par with their physical state—depressed to a most deplorable degree. The reduction in the hours of labour for children brought about, after a severe struggle, a better stath of things, but still there was much to do to make life pleasanter than it had been for the children. Time after time laws regulating child labour had been passed, all tending towards the introduction of a system which should give children an opportunity of acquiring, such an education as would, in after life, give them an equal opportunity with other nations of competing in the commercial markets. Mrs. CHILD, referring to the half-time question, said that in her opinion the age standard at which children could leave school ought to be raised, and the half-time system abolished altogether. It had been proved that the alleged hardship of finch an abolition was much exaggerated, and though there might be a few cases of individual suffering through such a course being adopted, yet the benefit to those young children who had to be dragged out of bed to go to work at a time when they ought to be sleeping the sleep of youthful innocence would, she thought, compensate for the few who would suffer by the change. During the discussion that ensued, a speaker said it appeared to him that the question of raising the age on which children should leave school was a most difficult one to deal with. Doubless most parents would wish their children to remain at school for a much longer period than was often the case; but on the other band, when he (the speaker) could point to hundreds of men who were not getting more than 245. to 268. per week, with families averaging from three to four each, how was it possible for such men to keep themselves, their wives, and children barely comfortable, let alone giving their children (often at the expense of their bodies) a good education. If employers of labour were made to give their employes a -‘ living wage ""—that was pay them wages in proportion to the profits they often made—then fathers who neglected under such circumstances to give their children a good, sound education, deserved to be heavily punished. If an employer of labour was getting rich, and able to send his sons and daughters to college, while those who worked for him made no progress in life, and were by circumstances compelled to send their children to work, then such an employer was unjustly retaing that which ought to go the comfort of his workpeople. Not until married women were enabled to live without having to eke out their husband's wages by working in the mill could the social condition of the people be brought with sight, and so long as employers were allowed to cheapen labour by employing married women in mills, so long would man's wages be kept to a starvation point. A hearty vote of thanks to Mrs. Child brought the meeting to a close. "

Every practical reader knows that frequent attention is necessary to keep the spindle points equidistant from the rollers at all points in the length of the carriage. This is a duty belonging to the spinner, who often takes little notice of the matter, so long as the spinning is right, but in cases of had spinning is constantly trying slight variations in the adjustment of the carriage bands. There is difference of opinion as to whether it is best to ""square the carriage"" while it is stopped ""going up"" or ""coming out,"" and whether it is not best to square it with the mule working, trusting to judgment as to whether the carriage is alighting in a level manner at the back stops. When making a thorough attempt to re-set the back shaft scrolls and ""square the carriage"" it is best to slacken out the steady band, and have the back shaft clutch box disengaged ; and in case of quadrant side shafts heing employed, the effect of the alterations of the back shaft on the quadrant must be noted, and readjustments of the quadrant made subsequently. It would be good practice to loosen all the carriage or draw bands, and then put all the under carriage bands under fair tension. Then the inclines on the back shaft scrolls should be set as required, arid all the back shaft bands tightened, while care is taken to keep the inclines in the proper position. Final adjustments to get the carriage ""square"" might afterwards be made, according to measurements, from the spindle points to the rollers, the carriage being stopped about a foot or so from the beam. Some minders will set the carriage a trifle farther out at the outside ends, while others prefer an exactly opposite procedure. "

The Corporation did not thus act on the same lines as the employers of labour. If a private employer had a man who desired an advance of salary, he considered if he could get as good servant for the same money his services would be dispensed with, and if he could not then in all probability he would increase the man's wages.

They had seen the work Mr. Holmes had done for the working classes during the last twelve years, and he did not think there was another man in Burnley who bad done a tenth part of the work that Mr. Holmes had during that time for the working people.—(Cheers.)

He trusted also that the time was not far distant when they would send a labour representative to Parliament from that town. —( Loud cheers.) Mr. ROCHE also supported the resolution, and suggested that a scheme should be devised whereby the working classes might be able to pay the rates by instalments.—(Cheers.) The motion was carried unanimously amid cheers. In responding, Mr. Hoi-vms said that whatever the result of that ward election might be, there seemed to be BO reason to doubt that it was the desire of the working classes in the town to have direct labour representation.—(Cheers.)

The Weavers' Catechism. Written specially for the benefit of the weavers of Burnley, by Bobby Shuttle and his wife Betty Reetnook, No. st, Starvation-street, near the Workhouse. What matter thongh their hands be hard, Their features brown and wan ; A Working Man's the work of God, And noble is the plan. Question.—What is thy name? Answer.—Poverty Knocker. Question.—Who gave thee that name. Answer.—Since I have tried to raise myself from my low position, and to save myself and family from the tender mercies of my taskmasters, they gave me that name in my struggles against monopoly, wherein I was made a member of strife, a child of oppression, and an inheritor of a bundle of rags. Question.—What did thy masters promise for thee? Answer.—They did promise and vow many things in my name: First.—That I should renounce the comforts of life through working for less money than the weavers in other towns, and starve my wife and hunger my children through the same cause. Second.--Thatl must not in any way try to better my condition but be content to work at any mice they think proper to give; neither must I join the Weaver's Union. as that is contrary to their bye-laws. Third.—That I must bear patiently the insults of all that are put in authority over me, and a host of other things too numerous to mention. Question.—llost thou not believe that thou art bound to do as they have promised thee? Answer.—No, verily; for I have come to the determination to free myself, and to strive to get as much for my work as the weavers in other places for the same kind and quantity, and that is the Blackburn Standard List. Question.—Rehearse the articles of thy belief? Answer.—l believe in the Golden rule—do unto others as you would have them do unto you—and in Honesty, his only son, who was conceived by our Common Right, born of the Virgin Truth, suffered under Cotton Treason, was crucified, dead, and buried in Burnley for many years, but is now risen again, and sitteth on the right hand of Justice and Liberty. Question.—What dost thou chiefly learn from these articles of thy belief? Answer.—l learn to believe that the time has now arrived when I must make a firm stand for a fair share in the profits of my industry, which is nothing less than the Blackburn Standard List— have nine hours' work, seven hours' play, eight hours' sleep out of every twenty-four. Question.—How many commandments are there? Answer.—Ten; the same which my master gave unto me the other day, saying I am thy lord and master, and I am determined to keep thee in bondage, that I may enjoy the profit. COMMANDMENTS.  Ist. Thou shalt have no other master but me. 2nd. Thou shalt not labour for thine own welfare, nor suppose that thou art not in my power; for I shall watch thee with a jealous eye, and will visit the sins of the father by sacking his children. 3rd. Thou shalt not atop off thy work until breakfast time, even it thou art sick; if thou does I shall stop thy wages and shop thy looms. 4th. Be thankful for the Sabbath day; six days shalt thou labour and toil, because I cannot compel thee to work seven; so lie in bed on Sunday, singing "" Britons never shall be slaves,"" and prepare for Monday morning. sth. Thou shalt tremble and shake when thou see'st the manager or cutlooker, and most flatter and reverence the overlooker, that thy days may be long in the shed that I thy master runneth. 6th. Thou shalt not join the Weavers' Union, because that will help thee to shake off my iron hand that has held thee so long. 7th. Thou shalt not grumble at being bated for nothing, as the bates help to pay the cutlooker. Bth. Thou shalt not be a witness against me in the County Court, if through any little. thing I think proper to stop thy week's wages; if thou does, I will sack the whole of thy family. 9th. Thou shalt not grumble at being sacked at a minute's warning when thou art feeble and not able to get as much work off as I want to be done. No excuse lmust be made, even if thou art overworked, and nearly choked with china clay. 10th. Thou shalt not covet a fair day's wages for a fair day's work, nor expect to be fairly dealt with; but must be content to live in ignorance and poverty; and must exert thyself both physically and mentally for my benefit, and when thou art no longer able to work, starve, or else go the Work:low:a.

The last publics sale of slaves in St. Lonis was in January, 1857 or 1858. A Cleveland gentleman who was present recently described the scene to me. The auctioneer was named Lynch, and the sale took place.on the Court House steps. A crowd of 50 or 75 men had collected to bid on the blacks they wanted, and to pick up bargains if any were offered. Well in front, clad in overalls and cowhide boots, and ornamented with short black pipes, were four Irishmen. They talked among themselves and gibed the deep-mouthed auctioneer. Americans and Germans stood about in silence, as if the sale of human beings was proper enough. The Irishmen, however, were in for fun as well as mischief. Directly a woman was brought out. She was old and thinly clad. "" How much do I hear for this woman?"" screamed the auctioneer.... s s s s  ""Be jabbers, he's a-sellin' his woife,"" exclaimed one of the Irishmen, loud enough to be heard in the next block.  ""That's not his wife, Pat, said the second Irishman. ""She's his mother. Did ye iver see the loike ?"" he continned, turning to his companions. ""Just think of a man who'll offer his cold mother to the highest bidder. I suppose yez'll be Benin' ver father next ?"" he screamed to the auctioneer. The crowd yelled with delight, and Lynch ordered the slave back to the pen. No one would bid a cent. The good-humoured sarcasm of the merry sons of Ireland was too much for the auctioneer. He coloured up, bit his lips, but wisely held his peace. A mother and her child were brought out next. The child clung to its mother's neck and hid its innocent face in the folds of a faded red kerchief. The woman evidently was no stranger to the block, for she looked the crowd over with a defiant eye, and smiled scornfully when she had taken in the scene.  ""A healthy mother and her young one—who will start the bidding ?"" cried the auctioneer, glancing suspiciously at the Irish contingent. ""Well, did ye iver ?"" said Pat, removing his pipe and drawing his wristband across a wide expanse of mouth. ""The ould thief wants to sell his own sister.""  "" It's his wife sure,"" exclaimed the red-headed companion of Pat, "" an' the young one she's got is his daughter. See the noses. If his nose isn't bike the young one's may St. Peter shut the dare in me face.""  The crowd roared afresh. Lynch glared at the row of Irishmen and vainly asked for an offer. No one would respond, and Pat and his friends continued their jeers. ""Kies the mild woman before she goes,"" said one. "" Bring out yer grandfather an' the rut o' the family,"" cried the second.  "" tile young one has hair like its loving father,"" screamed the third.  ""Hooray for free Americay !"" screamed the fourth, waving a dilapidated hat above his head. The spectators laughed immoderately, while Lynch became so furious that he declared the sale at an end, and immediately slunk out of sight, ard there were no more auctions of that kind in St. Louie.—"" Moro,"" in Cleveland Leader.

Last week I mentioned the fact that a swimming club was being organised in connection with the new baths. Nothing definite has yet been accomplished, but it is expected that within a fortnight the organisation will be an accomplished fact, or to indulge in a ""goak,"" it will be going on ""swimmingly.""  Whilst on this subject, perhaps it would not be uninteresting to mention that so long ago as 1879 there was a capital swimming club in existence in the town, the members of which have now chietty overgrown any propensity for indulging in aquatic exercise, at least of a very active character. Mr. Harry Taft, tobacconist, of Sankey-st., was the first captain*. .7. Lyon Whittle, the present Town Clerk, was the hon. sec.. and Mr..E. England wasthe treasurer. Councillor Josiah Whittle Wile made president, and there was cornmittft'of tbefollowing :—Messrs. M. Smart, S. ffehyon,James Sutton, W. Skelton, R. Wood. E. Caldwell, T. Welsby, Charles Halton, N. Powlson, and J. Beswick.  This club became very strong, and successful sports and fetes were common things with it. But at length its dissolution cams ; and the Corporation of Warrington were the cause of it. Seeing that the clubs' funds were augmentineconsiderably, the then civic fathers thought to obtain some of the ""spoil,"" and accordingly put up the price of the season tickets from 15s. to one guinea. There was a dispute, the result of which was that the club broke up. This, I hope, will convey its moral to the present Corporation.  There have been four times as many season tickets sold for the baths during the past two weeks, than were sold in any four months last year. This looks well ! "

DEATH OF AN OLD INIIABITANT.-011 Monday the remains of Joseph 'Thornle.y were interred at Sankey Cburth. Deceased was 83 years of age and was one of the o.idest inhabitants of the village.  MAY DAY.—May Day this year passed off about the same as usual. A large number of people journeyed to Knutsford despite the depressing state of the weather, in one of Mr. Connor's 'buses. There was also a procession of children who decked with ribbons and flowers, went singing round the village. FOOTBALL TRA PARTY.—Last evening week the second annual tea party and concert of the Penketh Association Football Club was held in the Wesleyan school. About 130 people partook of the excellent meat tea which was provided by the following :—Mesdames Longshaw, White, Bandies and F. Hughes. The tables were presided over by several young ladies, and the waiters were the members of the club. After tea a most enjoyable concert was given. Mr. G. Bandies, who took the chair apologized for the absence of Mr. J. B. Aitken. The Chairman said he was much disappointed at the result of the match with Warrington, which in his opinion was wrongly judged. Mr. F. Spensely gave a pianoforte solo which was well rendered. A song by A. Greenhalgh "" Comrades ""was next given and enthusiastically encored. Mr. A. Appleton in his rendering of "" The Pilot ""was very good, and a song by J. Cavanagh "" The Mountebanks "" elicited much applause. Mr. B. Spensely sang "" Soldier Jim ""in fine style and W. Ireland "" The moon hath raised her lamp above."" Mr. J. S. Haynes in the song "" The shopwalker, "" received a hearty encore. In the second part of the programme Professor T. Acton gave some of his wonderful sleight of hands tricks, and received a hearty round of applause. Songs were given by A. Appleton ""Jacks Wedding,"" J. Cavanagh "" Jolly Jack Tars,"" W. Ireland ""The Empress of the wave,"" B. Spensely "" I'm off to Philadelphia"" and another humorous song by J. S. Haynes"" The waiter"" and in response to a prolonged applause recited "" The charge of the Light Brigade '' in different dialects. A vote of thanks was moved to the ladies who had provided the excellent tea and to the helpers and artistes, by Mr. A. White and supported by G. Wilcox. Much praise also is due to Mr. J. Lewis and Mr. T. Earns, Mr, F. Spenslcy accompanied on the pianoforte. "

I know you must just have left her. I have traced you from the Park, my good woman. 1 understand all about he rescue of the boy, and that he is with his sister. t shepherd lad, who I met and deftly questioned, told me that, and also that Peggy Wilisey is too busy with the care of a dying friend to be longer trustworthy. I have not been to the Downs cottage myself, the meeting with the shepherd having apprised me folly of what I most wanted to know.""  ""Then most likely, you know where Miss Giralda is,"" said the housekeeper, with a ghastly amile.  ""Not so. My gentle shepherd grew suspicious when I asked him the question, and flatly declined to answer it. I offered him money but he was insensible to its charms. He said the lady had trusted him and spoken kindly to him, and he would not betray her. You see the superiority of beauty over mere lucre. But you, my good Pumpton, will not refuse me your confidence, I feel assured.""  There was a deadly glitter in his eyes before which the woman secretly quailed in sickening fear, but she looked up at him defiantly, and answered:  ""You think, my lord, that I am less faithful than a shepherd lad. You don't know me. Let me pass."" ""But did she go on the train? Did she go back to the Park, or to the Evergreens? You shall answer me, old woman. By heaven! I will loosen your tongue for you."" He caught at her bridle more closely as the horse pranced a little. Mrs. Pumpton was a woman of spirit. Her eyes flashed angrily at her persecutor. ""Hands off, my lord ! "" she cried.  He laughed, and drew nearer. With a quick, unexpected movement, the Park housekeeper snatched up her little riding whip, and brought it down with all her force upon the white jewelled hand of her enemy. With an oath and a cry of pain, Adlowe involuntarily withdrew his blood-marked hand, and his horse backed a few steps in affright. ""Let them teach you how to treat respectable, honest women, my Lord Adlowe,"" said Mrs. Pumpton, triumphantly. ""Now do your worst. We'll see which will win.""  She touched up her cob, and rode swiftly on her course, not deeming it best to return to Giralda, lest by doing so she should bring upon the maiden the discovery she desired to avoid. ""I can't do better than go to the Park,"" she thought. ""Miss Giralda is among friends, and that villain won't dare touch her, even if he finds her. And to-morrow Lord Grosvenor will be with her to protect her. She is surely safe."" Thus stifling her misgivings, Mrs. Pumpton continued her journey. Lord Adlo we, on his prancing, curveting steed, looked after her with a scowl of hatred.  ""I'll find that girl, if I have to search every house in Dalton,"" he muttered. ""First to the railway stations. Then to inquire of the street urchins and idlers if such a young lady has been seen here. Curse it all! she's made me enough trouble. She has yet to find that obstacles in my way are only so many incentives to pursuit. Ah I lam very near to you, Giralda Trevelyan. I shall soon have you in my power, never again to lose you."" He wrapped up his disfigured hand in his pockethandkerchief, and, full of vengeful passions, rode slowly into the town, sending vigilant glances on every side and at every window in the hope of catching sight of Giralda's face.

The Right Way and the Wrong Way of Treating Coughs. and Colds.  The advent of Peps, the pleasant pine-air treatment for throat, lung and chest diseases, has superseded oldfashioned treatment by medicines through the stomach as completely as modern methods in medicine have superseded the bleeding-cup. Medicines to benefit the lungs and bronchial tubes should obviously reach the affected parts direst. Peps convey the pleasant balsamic essenoes of the rich pine woods straight to the seat of the trouble.  Lungs. to Stomach,  A medicine for the chest and lungs is all wrong if it has to be merely swallowed into the stomach, which has no direct connection with the .lungs. You cannot swallow anything into ycur lungs. Old-time chest, lung and cough medicines are just as wrong-headed in effect as they are in composition. They are usually heavily drugged with opium, chloral, morphia, or some other narcotic,or else loaded with bromides or other sedatives. By dosing the nerves they often stop a cough, N 5 ithout removing the cause. It is dangerous to merely stop a cough, for coughing is Nature's way of expelling phlegm, disease germs, and other obstructions from the throat, lungs and chest. If you stop the cough before its work is done,by putting your nerves to sleep, your chest, throat and lungs get clogged up with impurities. Peps cure coughs and colds by making the cough easy, natural, and painless, and by destroying disease germs. . You simply take a little Pep from its silver paper wrapping and let it dissolve on the tongue,or crush it between the teeth. This releases the pine essences imprisoned in the tablet, and immediately the nasal cavities, the throat, the lungs, and the bronchial tubes are filled with the healing breath of the rich pine woods. Breathing becomes easy and natural when the breath is impregnated with the rich balsamic pine air from Peps; phlegm is loosened, and brings out with it all the dust and germs inhaled from polluted air; coughing is eased and allayed, and the clogged up air passages are cleared. , Be on your guard against substitutes and imitations. See that the registered name—Peps—is on every box you buy: There is nothing ""just as good ""as Peps. Of all chemists at is. 10. or 2s. 9d. per box, or post free at the same prices, from The Peps Pastille Co., Carlton Hill, Leeds, or C.

On Thursday last week, at noon, a sad drowning fatality occurred on the Bridgewater Canal at Appleton, near London Bridge. Two narrow boats, known as the John and William, from Rucorn, were proceedingalong the canal, the first one being steered by Job Jones and the second by his ten-year-old daughter Lily. When the boats had reached that portion of the waterway lying between Red-lane Bridge and London Bridge the child, who was sitting upnri the top of the cabin, near to the chimney, fell into the water. The occurrence was wit. nessed by her father, who got ashore as soon as he could and endeavoured to save his daughter by means of co boat-hook, being afraid to enter very far into the w as he was unable to swim. He did not succeed, however, and the child sank for the third time before assistance arrived. The body was recovered from the water, and Dr. Willett, who had been summoned, certified that life was extinct.  The inquest on the body was held on Friday morning at the London Bridge Inn,Appleton, before Mr. Worsley, coroner, when evidence agreeing with the above particulars was given by the father. Questioned as to what measures he adopted to rescue the deceased, the father informed the Coroner that he procured a shaft, but that proved too short to reach the child. He then got another and a longer shaft, and entered the water up to his waist, and at length she was pulled out of the water. He was enable to swim. The girl, through struggling, had worked herself a good distance from the bank. The length of time she was in the water would be about ten or fifteen minutes. No one else was about at the time of the occurrence, except witness land the boy who was driving the horse on the bank, but when the body was being pulled out of the water there was a large number of folks watching. His daughter was not accustomed to steering the boat, and she was only trusted to do so at meal times. Witness here admitted that on Thursday she was the only being nit the boat,and was in sole charge of it. Witness had made this arrangement owing to a boy,whose duty it had been to steer the boat,having left his employ at Runcorn. Witness thought that his daughter might be trusted to steer until they arrived at Man- ' chester. In witness's opinion the girl had fallen into the water through the chimney of the boat giving way,and against which she was leaning. The chimney hung over the side of the boat, being held in that position by a chain.—Mr. Coppock asked witness ii, on leaving Runcorn, he did not think that the boat was undermanned, to which witness replied that it had been his opinion "" then that his daughter could,until Manchester was reached, take the place of the boy. Mr. Cuppock considered that the steering of a boat from Runcorn to Manchester would be a severe tax upon a girl.—Anotherjuror asked witness if it was not possible for him to have reached his daughter before she sank for the third time.—Witness replied that it had been very difficult for him to get off the boat and then run to the spot where the girl had fallen in. It had also been very difficult for him to go so far in the water as he did, seeing that he could not swim.—The juror : Many a father would have gone further for his girl. William Bangle,nephew of the last witness,with whom he lived at Runcorn, spoke as to the measures adopted to save to girl. His uncle had sone into the water until it retched his waist, but not being then able to touch the girl he came out and used a longer shaft. By the time the body was reached life was extinct. Witness said he could not swim, neither could his uncle. He Win not aware of anybody having left his uncle's employ at Runcotn,he was not aware that a boy had been employed to steer the boat ; the deceased had steered the boat ever since the last witness had had charge of it, which was only a week agu. His uncle's wife also managed two boats with the assistance of a daughter and a son, so that four boats were being worked at once by his uncle and aunt jointly. The Coroner observed that the man seemed very thrifty, and was evidently trying to work the four boats as economically as possible. He recommended them to return a verdict of ""Accidental death,"" which the jury did accordingly, one juryman remarking that the father ought to be censured for having evaded the truth by telling them that the girl was in charge of the boat in consequence of a boy having left his employ. The suggestion was not, however, acted upon. "

Ile wanted no thanks, and he agreed with them that they had gained all they wanted to gain ; at any rate they had shown the opposite side that they could beat whoever was brought against them. (Applause.) Alderman FeeNcome expressed himself much pleased with the result of the day's work. Mr. C. S. BURGESS saki he congratulated the audience upon the magnificent victory which had been achieved that day, and he rejoiced that he had been allowed to take ever so small a part in the contest. They looked to the Government to give them measures for the amelioration of all classes of the community ; they expected that laws would be passed which would be for the bonefit of all. In conclusion,he wished Mr. Pierpoint health and strength to discharge the responsible duties which had been imposed upon him. Mr. J. GRACE said that the electors had that day proved themselves true to their Queen, their constitution and to themselves. Mr. PIERPOINT was then carried shoulder high across the room and down the steps into the street. He was at once recognised by a large crowd who assembled in the street. and was loudly cheered. Great excitement prevailed, and it was with no little difficulty, owing to the alarming rush which took place to get into the Conservative Club, that be succeeded in making his way into the second class billi room, where he delivered another speech standing on one of the billiard tables. He thanked the workingmen of Warrington for what they had done for him, and said he regarded himself as the workingmen's representative. They had that day returned him by a large majority, and they were a fresh example of those which had already been shown throughout the country. Several speeches were delivered in the first class billiard room before Mr. Pierpoint arrived. Councillor Amami BENNETT observed that he was sure he only expressed the general sense of that crowded and enthusiastic meeting when he said how proud they were that they had succeeded once more in returning Mr. Pierpoint and by an increased majority. They had less fear than ever now of losing the election unless a stronger candidate was brought into the field. They must acknowledge that their opponent had fought a plucky battle. and had fought it well. (Applause.) Councillor sMETIIIIRST asked the audience to join in singing ""God save the Queen."" This was done, cheers being given for the successful candidate. When Mr. PIERPOINT entered the room he was loudly cheered. Mounting one of the billiard tables he delivered another speech. Ile said that years ago at a municipal election he thought it his duty as the then Chairman of the Conservative Association to address some hard words to the members of that body, but he was happy to say that since that time the work of the Conservative party had been completed. (Cheers.) To use a Lancashire phrase it had been "" jannock."" (Hear hear.) The electors had that day returned him te Parliament by a magnificent majority, and if he had done his duty durint_t the past three years, and had merited their thanks, he assured them that those thanks had been given most thoroughly and most heartily. He should never forget that night, nor should he ever forget the grand and great work which had been done for the cause which he had the honour to represent. He asked them, as he had done in the other room in the building, to use their influence at other elections which had not yet been decided, and to work for the Unionist candidates— (hear, hear)—so that they might make the tide which was flowing with them flow in greater volume. He hoped that other constituencies would emulate the noble example which had been set by Derby. (Applause.) Mr. Pierpoint then left the club, and was escorted home by a large crowd,several persons carrying torches. Great excitement prevailed,and it was some hours before it subsided and the streets resumed their usual appearance. -CONGRATULATING THE CANDIDATES.  On Monday night, about an hour alter the declaration of the pall Mr. Scott received the following congratulation on his plucky fight for Liberalism in Warrington ""Hearty congratulations from the National Liberal Club on your splendid fight • regret result.""

THE WARRINGTON TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION AND THE CANDIDATES. A number of members of the Warrington and District Teachers' Association waited on both Parliamentary candidates early on Monday, and requested their answers to the following questions : I. Are you iu favour of a State-aided superannuation scheme for elementary teachers ? H. Will you support a Bill to secure reasonable security of tenure, and to prevent the dismissal of a teacher save for a reasonable and assigned cause? 111. Are you in favour of an early raising of the present age for juvenile labour ? IV. Are you in favour of removing Article 73 from the Code ? It may be explained that the last question refers to certain disabilities under which non-collegiate certificated teachers labour. Replies in the affirmative to each question were returned by both Mr. Scott and Mr. Pierpoint.  MEETING OF IRISHMEN ALD CATHOLICS.  On Sunday afternoon, a crowded and enthusiastic meeting of Irishmen and Catholics was held in Ohmy's Circus, in support of Mr. Scott. All the local leaders of the Irish and Catholics were present, and the chair was occupied by Mr. T. Kiernan. The CHAIRMAN in his opening speech ridiculed the idea that it was necessary to be born in Warrington in order to boa member. He said that he did not think many there were born in Warrington. (Hear, hear.) That meeting was called to show that the Catholics and Irish people of Warrington were not going to follow the lead of Mr.Pierpoint. (Applause.) He had been speaking in Brick-st. that week, and since then his Tory friends had never left him alone, especially since they had read the report of his speech in the "" Examiner "" on Saturday. j At that meeting he had said that the word Tory meant a robber. Well, he had looked at the Imperial dictionary and found that he was quite correct. He would read them the meaning of the word Tory from the dictionary. Mr. Kiernan, amid much laughter read the meaning, and said that the Tories had found that their name was a bad name and had accordingly changed it and called themselves Conservatives, and now they were again changing their name to Liberal Unionists. (Applause.) He contended that the name Tory was very applicable to them in Warrington because they had been stealing from the circular sent round by the Catholic Bishops. He, however, appealed to his hearers to support the Liberal party. He denied that it was the duty of the Catholics to support the Tory party on the education question. He hoped that they would on Monday wrench the Warrington representation I rem the domination of the Tory party who had held it so long. (Applause.) Mr. Murmars then addressed the meeting. He appealed to his fellow countrymen to support the Liberal party who were pledged to Home Rule. He said that they could do much for their countrymen in Ireland,and hoped they would do their duty to them. Referring to the education question, he denied that the Catholics would serve their cause by voting for the Tory party. He would remind the Nonconformists that all the Catholics asked for was equality. (Applause.) He appealed to those present to support Mr. Scott on Monday.  Further addresses were given by Councillor Macabe and Mr. Farrally of Manchester, and Mr. J. C. Dalton, and a vote pledging the meeting to use every legitimate means to secure the return of Mr. Scott was passed unanimously. "

I had only one wish in life, and that was to die and be released from agony."" What efforts, then, did you make to obtain a cure?"" asked Use reporter. "" I went as an in-patient to the hospital, and after treatment there, I was discharged as cured, but two months afterwards I was as bad as ever.

""I am glad to have tke chance of telling you. A young girl who was working in my department of the mill, three or four years ago got so weak that she could not stand, and was only fit to lie down and faint away. She went off work for a fortnight's rest, but got no better. After a while, however, she returned to work quite strong and cheerful, and I was curious enough to ask haw she had managed to overcome her complaint so thoroughly. She replied "" I have been cured by two boxes of D. Williams' pink pills for pale people,' and thinking to meself that if the pills had done her g-,01 they should do the same for me. I purchased a box, and after taking the cotta I noticed a slight improvement.

At the Birmingham Police Court, on Thursday, William McDonnell, 34 years of age, manager of the Royal Oak, King-street, Wednesbury, as brought up on a charge of treason felony. The prisoner was apprehended at his residence late on the previous night by Detective-Inspectors Stroud and Stephenson, Birmingham, and Superintendent Holland, Wednesbury, and brought at once to Birmingham, arriving at midnight. Mr. Farndale, in applying for a remand until Saturday, said it was necessary, in order that the prisoner might be brought up with Egan and Daley, who was at present in custody at Birkenhead. His worship would recollect that Mr. Poland, in his opening speech on Saturday morning, referred to a letter foand in the canister, buried in the garden at Egan's horse, from William McDonnell, of Wedoesbary, who signed himself ""district centre."" In consequence of that letter, and other letters from the prisoner found at Egan's house, he (Mr. Farndale) proceeded to McDonnell's house on Wednesday morning to investigate , the matter. He was assisted by Superintendents Black and Holland, of the Staffordshire Constabulary. After having I an interview with the prisoner and several other people in Wednesbury, he communicated the result of his investigations to the Home Secretary, and on Wednesday night, from i a telegram received from the Home Office, he ordered ' McDonnell's arrest. He was requested to apply for a remand until Saturday, in order that he might be brought up with the other prisoners.—The Stipendiary (to thh prisoner) : Have you any reason why you should not be re- ' manded ?—Mr. Corbett said he appeared for the prisoner, and he had no objection to a remand until Saturday. Ile, however, applied for bail, the prisoner being a most respectable man and well known.—Mr. Farndale said Captain Congreve, chief constable of Staffordshire, was present, and also the superintendent of Wednesbury. They had known the prisoner for some time, and after consulting them he must oppose the application.—The Stipendiary: On such a charge as this I should not be justified in allowing bail. You will be remanded until Saturday. In Birmingham considerable importance is attached to the arrest of the alleged dynamitard, William M•Donnell, a Wednesbury publican. It is stated that Daley, during the time he was watched was followed on several occasions to SPDonnell's house, which, it is believed, was a favourite meeting place of the Fenian brotherhood in the Black Country. The documents which were found at Egaa's house are very compromising in face of this fact, as many of them are dated from M‘Dennell's house, and he has had several documents addressed to him by EgAn. The arrest , has caused great excitement throughout the Black Country and in Birmingham, more especially as it is believed other arreste will follow. Numerous persons have been constantly i watched by the police for weeks past.  A Dublin correspondent states that an action by a young lady ef 21, who has been a ward of Chancery; with an income of £3OO a year, has been commenced against an octogenarian Irish connty court judge for breach of promise of marriage, the damages being laid at 18,000.

A singular case was heard by the Cheshire County magistrates at Macclesfield, on Tuesday. Frederick Rutland, a professed spiritualist medium, was charged with abducting a girl 11 years of age, named Maly Hatton, from the house of her uncle, a farmer at Alderley. Defendant had been employed by the girl's mother as a grocer's assistant, but was discharged, as she fancied an improper familiarity existed between him and the girl. He, however, enticed the girl to his lodgings, where seances were held, and alleged that the spirit of her deceased father instructed him to take special care of Milly. Afterwards the girl went to his lodgings, from whence she was taken by her uncle, but left on Christmas Eve, and was afterwards seen in defendant's company at a neighbour's house. He shook hands and kissed her. She left the house with him and a male friend, and has not been seen since. It was stated that the girl was now residing at Garston, near Liverpool, in lodgings taken by defendant's friend. The magistrates wished the girl to be produced, and the case was adjourned, the defendant being remanded on bail. "

Ample justice was done thereto, after which the Rev. Mr. Rhodes was voted to the chair, and several complimentary toasts were duly honoured. The band played at intervals during the afternoon, and also sang several of their popular glees, which were heartily enjoyed. Altogether a very enjoyable day was spent.

Mr. Meeeon selected as his text ROMVIS i, 20, "" For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse."" He said : The honour of the grand discovery of the circulation of the blood, one of the greatest that waa ever made in physiology, is due to an Englishman, Wm. Harvey, who publialied the results of his discovery about the year 1630. We have spoken on former occasions of the late of Galileo and the religious opposition to Copernicus and to the first geologists, ; and there is a similar sad interest about the manner in which even his splendid discovery was received by the public. Harvey for some tune scarcely made • single convert and a great outcry was raised against him for calling in question the authority of the ancients. And when his antagonists found them. selves foiled in argument they did not scruple to raise against him the weapons of superstition and prejudice insinuating that his new doctrines would tend to subvert the credit of the Bible and thus undermine the foundations of religion. I think we have seen that believers in the Bible have nothing to fear from, but may gladly welcome the revelations of astronomy and geology. And we purpose to-night, to enquire whether the heart and the circulation have not something to tell us about the Creation. In reply to the question of a friend, Harvey said that what induced him to think of the circulation was that when he took notice of the valves in many parts of the body, so placed that they gave free passage to the blood towards the heart, but opposed the passage of the venous blood the contrary way, he was invited to think that so:prudent • cause as Nature had not placed so many valves without • design, and no design seemed more probable than that, since the blood could not well because of the intervening valves, be sent by the veins to the limits, it should be sent through the arteries:, and returned through the veins, whose valves) did not oppose its course that way. Harvey here speaks of 'design "" in the circulatory system and we purpose to work the argument for deeign and a designer along the. lines.

Tin politic' principles which guided the poliey of the Memeow Gazette when it was conducted by the late M. Katkoff are still paramount in the columns of that influential Panslavist journal. It warns the Russian Government to beware of the friendly advances of Germany, which are only meant to serve a selfish purpose, and recalls the fact that it was Prince Bismarck, chairman of the Conference, who had the chief hand in getting the Berlin Treaty put into the shape it finally took. It was M. Katkoffs dislike of German influence in Europe that caused him to favour the Russo-French alliance, and his successor follows faithfully in his footsteps in this respect.  Ton hearty cheers, indicative of good wishes, which were given to Mr. J. Bell, owner of the yacht Thistle, on the occasion of his leaving the Mersey on board the Anchor liner City of Rome for New York, showed the great interest which is taken on our own as well as on the other side of the Atlantic in the forthcoming international race in American waters. Mr. Bell, before leaving, expressed the confidence he felt as to the likelihood, apparently amounting to certainty, of the Thistle winning the America cup; and yachting experts belonging to the Empire City seemed to entertain a similar belief when they saw the Thistle in her racing rig, making trial sails, and gliding through the water swiftly with easy grace. The race for the America cup will far transcend in interest the Jubilee yacht race round the British Islands.  THE agreement arrived at between the British and United States Governments to appoint a joint Commission for the purpose of drawing up rules and regulations to put an end to the vexatious fisheries disputes which are continually cropping up, has been well received in both countries, and the New York papers have expressed approval of the selection of Mr. Chamberlain as the Chief of the British Commission. By his acceptance of this appointment, which necessitates his going to Canada, Mr. Chamberlain will be unable to carry out his intended project of making a political csmpaign in Ulster. It is to be hoped that the new Fisheries Commission will take warning from the failure of former treaties, and endeavour to make the new one as perfect as possible.  AT the West Ham Police-court, London, the presiding magistrate, Mr. Baggally, had a case before him possessing peculiar interest for those inhabitants of the metropolis who are careful as to the kind and quality of food they eat. Mr. John Barber was fined the full penalty of five pounds with costs for having used his knackersyard as a slaughter-house, where the carcases of horses were prepared and dressed for butchers and sausage-makers. As the people of this country have not hitherto been considered hippaphagous, it was a fortunate thing that Mr. Barber's practices attracted the notice of an inspector, and led to his being served with a summons. It came out in evidence that in the months of April and May an active business went on in the way of slaughtering horses, the carcases of which were .to be sold, in one form or another, as food for man. Suspicion has always attached to the contents of sausages, and this suspicion must naturally be intensified by what has come to light, in connection with this ease, at the West tram Police-court. An appeal was taken against the magistrate's decision, and this will have the beneficial effect of making the facts more widely known.  Is: the case of Mrs. Little, who was crushed to death by a tramcar on Southend Pier, the coroner's jury who held an inqbeet on the body gave their verdict as ""Accidental death,"" ' and acquitted the driver and conductor of all blame. But the authorities of the town were certainly to blame for allowing so dangerous a tramway line to be laid down on the pier, which is a public promenade, and much frequented by visitors in the summer and autumn months. The unfortunate victim of the fatal accident had only arrived at Southend with her two young daughters, one of whom was seriously injured at the time her mother was killed, on the morning of the day when the melancholy occurrence took place, and she was, therefore, unaware of the extreme danger she ran by walking on the wrong side of the pier. A notice-board ought at least to have been put up when the tramway was constructed for the guidance oi visitors to the watering-place.  H MVP, r reports from all parts of the country show that, while the long drought prejudicially sheeted corn and barley, the yield of the wheat crop is above the average. In Scotland there is a great deficiency, both as regards ear and straw in the oat crop, which is more largely cultivated there than any other kind of cereals. In Americathe wheat crop is the heaviest that has been known for many years, and the same has also to be said respecting Canada. "

The first of the course of sermons on ""The Use and Abase of the World and the Things that are in the World,"" announced for delivery at St. James'e, Piccadilly, Loudon, on the Sundays alter Easter, was preached on Sunday afternoon by Dr. Goulburn. the Dean of Norwich. Taking for his text 1 Con vii. 2931, the Dean commence l by defining the "" abuse"" of the world as consisting in over-doing its use in tl,essn,esenee that the glutton or the drunkard abuses two of the chief of God's gifts, while he showed that it was truly "" used "" by those who were guided by restraint and self control. Approaching the Pubject more imme diately before him, the preacher compared the influence of the world to that of the atmosphere with which the body is surrounded, its two chief ingredients being the influence of society and the influence of the present system of things, which is radically faulty and vicious. The influence of society, though noiseless, was, the Dean argued, stronger than many direct forces, and resembled the force of gravitation as contreated with the more showy force of electricity. Public opinion he described as the only tyrannical power which Englishmen endured, and in strong satirical language he spoke of their miserable fe ir of its organs and their compli mice with Is laws, Faahion, again, taking an outward form and becoming, so to speak, in. carnate, was another great influence, which, added to those already named, made up the strong force for evil which is called the world. Referring secondly to the vicious system under which we are living, the preacher alluded first to our pursuits, on all of which he asserted the brand of sin is marked. Agriculture primarily resulted from sin. Warlike pursuits were the necessary sequence r,f the present state of life. The study of medicine, illustrious and bmeticial as it is, would be needleas if there wore no sin, and therefore no disease or death. Jurisprudence naturally follows from the disagreements of men. Even .the Christian nitniatry finds its chief function in reclaiming the sinner. In short there is, the Dean urged, no human pursuit which is not intended to remedy evil, and therefore may be said to spring from it. The accumulation of property in the hands of the rich was next referred to, and although it war declared to be sanctioned by God, it was to be traced in the first instance to evil.

Chance v Dudley Hill.—At the County Court, on Thursday, before R. Kettle, Esq., Dudley Hill, of the Lye, was summoned by Joseph Chance, a trustee of the Foresters Court Union, for the sum of us 11d. Mr. Perry appeared for plaintiff, who said that defendant was engaged to collect money for the court, and he was to receive 6d in the pound. Defendant had collected £4l 3s 6d, and paid over £39 48 2d. This was corroborated by Ambrose Southall. Defendant denied that any arrangement for prices was named, and made a set off of 12s 6d for work done. This was not proved to the satisfaction of His Honour, who gave a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed and costs.  Godding v Beettle.—This was an action to recover the sum of ..t4 Is 9d, money received by defendant for plaintiff. Mr. Clulow defended. Plaintiff, Matthew Godding was a lessee of tolls, and the defendant had charge of a gate, and had received the money for his master while in charge, and plaintiff produced notes of the amounts received by him, which he now sought to recover. On cross-examination plaintiff admitted that he had to pay to a child that the defendant had had by him. Mr. Clulow for the defence, produced several post cards and letters written by plaintiff, and sent to the defendant, and one was "" Pay for your third bastard child."" Defendant was the put in the box. She admitted receiving the money, and said that the plaintiff gave it to her to pay for her confinement, and attendance while ill. Mr. Kettle: This is a case brought by Matthew Godding, of Rood End, near Oldbury, to recover the sum of ..£4 is 9d for Mary Brettle. This is oath against oath which makes it difficult to decide. When I look at these letters and cards sent by plaintiff to defeuea,nt, and admitted to be the handwriting of plaintiff I have no difficulty in deciding. The mg-n who wrote them is as great a coward as ever came into court to act in the way he has done, and I find a verdict for the defendant. ILLEGAL DISTRESS.—Hart v Hill.—This was an action brought by Eliza Hart against Dudley Hill, of the Lye, for illegally making a distress. Mr. Perry appeared on behalf of Mr. Collis for the plaintiff, and Mr. Homer defended. Plaintiff proved that the dedefendant came with George Cuttler, and took a chest of drawers worth 30s, and a clock worth 245, and that the goods were still in the possession of the defendant at the time the distress was made. No demand had been made for the rent. Defendant was ordered to pay ..£5 is Ott damages, to be reduced to ~e 2 when the goods were given up.—George Brooks brought a similar action, and His Honour gave -25 is 0(1 damages to be reducedi when the goods were given up.

Active canvassing was carried on by each gentleman during the early part of the week, causing no little amount of interest amongst the parishioners, and the fortunes of the two two gentlemen have accordinglys been the topic of the day in the village. The polling commenced at 12 o'clock and ended at 6 in the evening, when Mr W. Elders was declared at the head of the poll by a majority of 11 votes.  AN UNRULY FRMALE.—On Tuesday morning the Stockton Borough Magistratis had before them a middle-aged woman named Sarah Regan on a charge of behaving in a violent manner in the streets.

ASSAULTING A WOMAN.—A man named James Armstrong was summoned before the South Stockton Bench on Monday for assaulting a young woman named Isabella Liggett.

They are to-day being provided with a substantial meal of excellent soup and bread, instead of tea as heretofore. DRUNK IN A POLICE COURT.—A middleaged man named James Carrick was brought before the Stockton Borough Magistrates on Wednesday morning on a charge of being drunk. On Tuesday morning the attention of Sergeant Gould was drawn to the prisoner, who was then in the police-court, behaving in a manner which showed him to have been imbibing rather too freely. On getting him outside into the court-yard the sergeant found that the prisoner was too much intoxicated to walk home, and he therefore escorted him to the ""lock-up.""— Prisoner did not now deny the charge, and was fined 5s and 5s Gd costs, with the alternative of 14 days' imprisonment with hard labour.  PRECAUTIONS AGAINST FIRE AT STOCKTON. —Some time ago the Stockton Corporation considered the expediency of increasing the facilities for extinguishing fires within the borough, cud it VMS deemed necessary to fix pillar hydrants in several parts of the town. Different kinds of hydrants were therefore tested, and two eventually erected. It is now intended to fix hydrants of Messrs Shard, Mason, and Co.'s manufacture at four other points—namely, between Messrs G. Y. Blair's and the Stockton Forge Company's, another at the corner of Bishopton-lane ; another near the corner of Prince Regent-street, and a fourth at the top of Bishop-street. These hydrants are constructed on the most approved principles, and are precisely similar to those supplied to the city of London authorities.  A SOCLLL GATHERING.-011 Friday night week a very pleasant social gathering was held in the Alma-street Schoolroom, Stockton, in connection with the Congregational Total Abstinence Society. Mr A. Mollison, senr., occupied the presidential chair,and short and appropriate addresses were delivered by Councillor J. Alderson, Mr J. C. Macdonald, Mr Jewitt, ctc.

OBSTRUCTING A FOOTPATH.—A man named Henry Nelson was summoned at the Stockton Petty Sessions on Thursday morning for obstructing the footpath. Defendant did not appear, and the service of the summons having been proved, the Bench proceeded to hear the evidence in his absence. It appeared that at ten o'clock on Sunday night a constable found the defendant standing in Bishop. street in a state of semi-intoxication. He had • large crowd around him, and refused to go away when requested by the police. He was consequently taken into custody. —The Magistrates imposed a penalty of 5s and 8s 6d costs, waif the alternative of fourteen days' imprisonment with hard labour. VEGETARIANISM AND TEMPERANCE.-011 Monday evening a Vegetarian hepast was partook of at the Temperance Hall, Georgestreet, South Stockton, by a large number of adults and children. The object of the "" banquet "" was to direct the attention of the inhabitants to the subject of a cheap and healthy diet, without the addition of animal food. Mr W. M. Wright (who is well known for the interest he has taken in dietic reform) had kindly consented to preside, and several members of the Juvenile Lodges of local Templars assisted to make the entertainment a success by providing specimen dishes of vegetarian breakfasts, dinners, and sappers.

Waldy, J.P. -It appeared from the weekly report of the Master of the Workhouse that the total number of inmates today is 329, the number last Board day was 336, and the number on the corresponding day last year was 316.—Mr Harrison enquired whether any steps had yet been taken towards getting another room in which the meetings of the Board might be beld.—The Clerk (Mr Robinson) replied that the committee had not'met yet, but that he was obtaining information to lay before them on the subject. —On the suggestion of the Rev. Thomas Law, the meeting of the committee in question was allowed to stand over till after the election of the new Board.—The remainder of the business consisted of the approval of the minutes of the School Attendance Committee, etc., in which there was nothing of general interest.  FENMYHILL IRONWORKS.—In consequence of the lung depression in the iron trade and consequent low prices quoted, it has been I decided to blow out the two remaining furnaces in operation at Ferry Hill Ironworks, and the men are this week engaged in doing so, and by Monday next work will cease, andt be whole of the f urn acemen will be thrown oat of employment. A staff of men will still, of course, be employed in sending out iron already made and in stock, of which there is upwards of 40,000 tons; but not many will be necessary for this work. The inhabitants of Thrislington and surrounding places are already in great distress, and a good many families are emigrating to New Zealand and other countries. JUVEVILE TEMPLARY AT SOUTH STOCKTON. —On Wednesday evening, under the auspices of the South Stockton's Future Hope Temples No. 1110 and 1250, a successful and interesting vegetarian banquet was held in the Temperance Hall, which was well attended. Mr W. M. Wright, of Stockton, presided, and in an appropriate address advocated the adoption of a more economic dietary, which would be conducive to hygiene and prosperity; and also (during the admiuietration of the various specimens of food submitted to the meeting's gastrononic manipulation) lucidly expatiated on their respective bearings on economy and nutrition. The articles were kindly provided by the following ladies Mrs Lumley, Mrs Jones, Mrs Robinson, Mrs Lewis, Mrs Wright, Mrs Tanfield, and Mrs Aelley, and Miss Love, Miss Robinson, Miss Jones, Miss Lumley, Miss Sudron, Miss Buley, Miss Stafford, Miss Jennings, Miss Lord, Miss Tilley, and Miss Mitchell, and distributed by the latter young ladies in a commendable and creditable manner.

TEE LOVER'S LEAP. There is a voice comes o'er the wave, At eve, when the wind is dying, A sepulchral sound from the deep sea grave, Where the mariner lone is lying; The sea-wrack decks his watery bed, And weaves wild tresses round his head. Where the light-house gleams above the steep, Like a star in the darkness flashing; And rocks emerge from the billowey deep, On which the wild waves are dashing, A stranded barque, by the tempest driven, Is wreck'd in sight of its destin'd haven. Up on high, on the beetling cliff, Which darkly frowns on the ocean— Where below the life-boat seem'd a skiff, Toined about with the waves commotion— A gentle maiden timorous stood, And gazed intent on the raging flood. Often her hands were lifted high, As a signal white she was waving, And a loved name rose with her frenzied cry, As round her the winds were raving ; A shriek l—the frail barque on the rock was toss'd, Oulph'd in the deep, and the mariners lost. And the maiden lonely, where is she The signal no more is flying Down the cliff she has plunged in the sea, And her mangled form is lying A lifeless corpse upon the strand, Saved from the sea by a stranger's hand. The storm has passed, the broken wreck Around on the shore is floating, And weeping maids with flowers deck The grave of two lovers doating , Then nightly comes a wail on the surge, And the wild winds chant the lover's dirge.  THE AMERICAN QUESTION. (From the Morning Post) England awaits with calmness, but not with indifference, the answer of the Federal Government to the demands of Lord Lyons. In the. meantime there is bat one feeling among all sensible men throughout the country. Englishmen are as one man in sincerely hoping that that answer may be frank, full, and satisfactory; and in firmly resolving that if it be not such as they are entitled, for their own honour's sake, to claim, they will instantly take effectual measures to convince those who have insulted them that they cannot do so with impunity. There will be no pause, no hesitation, no looking two ways, should the telegram reach England that Lord Lyons is on his way home. An alert Government, an Administration efficient at all points an army and navy never equalled in this country for strength, excellence, and equipment, and, above all, a unanimous people, will combine to teach the:Federal States and all other, that if they would remain at peace and amity with England they must respect the law of nations, abstain from offering insult, and from setting inconvenient precedents. The English people have no desire to go to war with any Power whatever, least of all with their own flesh and blood. They wish to be allowed to prosecute their commercial enterprises, to develop their colonial resources, to reduce their army and navy, to get rid of the income tax, to assist the commerce of the world, and to cultivate the improvement and happiness of mankind. These Are dearer objects to all classes of Englishmen than the spoils of war, the vanity of conquest, or the excitement of continual quarrel. But it is no part of manliness to stand insult, no part of honourable forbearance to put great interests in peril ; and therefore we must insist that passengers in our commercial vessels, being civilians, shall be as free on board our ships as they would be on shore, from whatever port they come. and on whatever errand, so that it be not ostensibly belligerent. Mr Bright's voice is the only one in England that lias been raised against the honour and the interests of his own country. He alone, of all public men, has called upon the nation to lick the feet of those who have insulted her. He and Smith O'Brien are the only men who seem not to know what an insult is, what the honour of England is, or what is the duty of Englishmen towards their Queen, O'Brien and Bright, the self-constituted exponents of the exact opposite of the mind of England, will he names of honour among the fratricides of America, as they are of derision among the loyal men of their own country. It is necessary that Englishmen should utterly disavow these two names. Men who can stand forward at a crisis like this to lower their country in the eyes of those who have insulted her, who have the impudence to make a show of expounding the English mind, by statements that are read the next day with indignation and disgust, deserve no quarter, and in honourable English minds they will receive none. The great question on which peace or war turns will most likely be decided before the unworthy speech of the Member for Birmingham reaches Washington, so that there is no danger of any misrepresentation of the mind of England doing mischief there. The energetic measures of the Government, the augmentation of the West Indian squadron, and the concentration of troops in Canada, will best tell what we think of the conduct of the Federal Government. Should it endorse the proceedings of the San Jacinto, the random speeches of this agitator or that will count for little one way or the other when the Southern blockade is being broken, the army divided between Northern and Southern duty, and all the Federal ports of entry guarded by the British fleet. This will be the exposition of the English mind if right and justice cannot be had without it. But, stern as is the will of England in this matter, war is the last thing we desire. We have done nothing to provoke it; and, should it come, we shall have nothing to reproach ourselves with. We will not eat dirt to avoid it, but if it can be obviated by honourable means, we are ready to entertain them. But we have also the right to dictate the terms on which we will remain friendly. This we have done. The answer to our demands must be categorical. We can have no compromise; no subterfuge. We ask nothing humiliating to the Federal Government. If, as is said, their officer acted without instructions, they have only to repair the mischief he has done on the terms we have dictated, and there will be an end of the matter. But it is to be feared that they have already committed themselves by accepting the four captives as prisoners of war. By prolonging the captivity of these gentlemen, they practically adopt the acts of Commodore Wilkes; and it may be difficult now, in the face of illdirected popular enthusiasm, to retreat from the position. But with that we have nothing to do; and, in pite of Mr Bright's want of patriotism and Smith O'Brien's impudence, we shall insist on our demands, and fight if they are not complied with. "

Expectation has long been on the stretch for news of a decisive character from the seat of war. Little, however, has transpired to gratify the curious, and the termination of this fight among brothers seems as far off as ever. If we are to believe the North American papers, there have been several battles, in which the Southerners have been whipped, with the loss of thousands killed and wounded; but when we have the truth brought to light, the reverse is too often the case, and we find Jonathan has been killing his enemies with ""a long bow."" There have, indeed, been one or two decisive movenrents among both armies, but the Confederates have had the best of it. The taking of Lexington by General Price, was an important affair, and is likely to lead to something still more important. A battle betweea the Federalists, under General Fremont, and the Confederates, under General Price, is now imminent, and is likely to produce results of no common nature in this extraordinary war: Both sides are preparing for a severe and, we fear, a bloody struggle. Should fortune favour Fremont and the north, he will be regarded with extraordinary favour by the people, and hailed by them almost in the light of a dictator. He is, undoubtedly, a liberator, and proclaimed freedom to the slaves, but was unceremoniously. snubbel' ',y the President for so doing, and requested to withdraw his proclamation to that effect. Should he prove victorious over his antagonist Price, he may probably follow up Ins intentions and give freedom to the slaves as he proceeds on his career, and the people will back him ; but should fortune favour the other side, there will be little' chance for the poor slaves for some time. We fear for the result. Somehow the pro-slavery party got the beat of it in the battle field. The most important victories have been won by them, evidently to the satisfaction of most people, because the Northerners brag so much, and send forth such false reports to deceive, while the Southerners are content to accomplish their object as well as they can, and are nearly silent upon it. We know very little of their movements beyond the Potomac. They are stationed on its banks in large numbers, and appear to have threatened Washington, but another change has taken place. It now appears that the Confederates have for the last few weeks been imposing, and very successfully too, on the Federal army of the Potomac by their advanced positions on the Potomac. They had left their ground for two days before their antagonists were aware of their movements, and when -the latter advanced and occupied the deserted positions they found that the foral:lable-looking entrenchments were of the most ordinary construction, and that their rows of artillery were mere painted logs. Their object in retreat is the subject of much Federal guessing; it is to be hoped that, among other speculations' the likelihood of its being a renewal of the Bull's Run trap will not be forgotten by them. From Missouri, too, the news is interesting, though chiefly as showing the exaggeration of the former accounts published by the Northern newspapers. Lexington remains in the hands of the Confederates; the troops that had gone up from all quarters, too late to rescue Mulligan, but time enough to besiege Price within his newly acquired conquest, have all somehow disappeared, and the Federals themselves are in straits, and calling for more reinforcements. General Fremont's expedition down the Mississippi is still talked of, but it is as far from starting as ever. Last of all, we have the official report of General Price as to his loss in the capture of Lexington. The Federal papers, it will be remembered, killed 4000 of his troops in one fight ; the general himself puts his killed down at 23, and his wounded at 74. Probably there is exaggeration on both sides. But bow are dull matter-of-fact Englishmen to keep pace with these splendid mendacities '1 General Beauregard has hidden his meaning so well, that no one seems able to guess i whether the evacuation of the positions n the centre of his line is the commencement of a retreat or part of a plan for the delivery of a general battle. On the latter of these assumptions, it is held that Munson's Hill was occupied by the Southerners as a stratagem, the end of which is attained now that they have completed their preparations of crossing the river both above and below Washington. In support of this view, it is observed that they .had just shown themselves in considerable force on the upper river, near Leesburg, where the stream is narrow and fordable, and that they had quietly given a vast increase of strength to their batteries along the lower river, from Occoquan to M.lthias Point, where, indeed, they boasted of having established an entire command over the navigation of the Potomac. We have little doubt of being supported by the sympathies of the real friends of humanity all over the world, if we express a hope that the supposition which imputes to the Confederates a design to try a forward movement on a large scale is the correct one. Bloodshed is not a thing that is desirable, except where it is inevitable; and then, the sooner it comes the better. Neither North nor South can now be expected to arrange their differences without, at least, one more trial of strength in the open field. The former cannot well hearken to reason, even if it desires to do so, until the stain of its previous military disasters have been wiped out; and the chances of the latter being compelled to yield to any force that can be brought against them become smaller every day. . In the meantime, while both parties are carrying on this wicked warfare, the trade and commerce of. the country are going to ruin. The merchants of the North cannot do without the cotton-growers of the South, and while they are driving away their commercial prosperity, and preparing no cotton for England, she is learning how futile is her dependance upon such a broken reed, for the staple trade of her markets at home and over the world, and is making ill haste to provide her supply of cotton from her own territories. In this matter good will come out of the evil, and whatever may be the result of this internecine war to American institutions it has permanently loosened her hold upon England, who is rapidly bringing other influences to bear against her great productive interest in cotton which will very considerably lower her standard of importance both in her own land sad in the worki.  _.sellll  k _ i  I  I  ,_... 1/ e "

The finished iron trade continues dull. Rail makers receive occasional enquiries, and one or two orders have been booked, but the prices obtained are very low. The shipbuilding trade is in an unsatisfactory state. One of the Tees shipyards has not a single vessel in hand, and another is only about half occupied, without much prospect of obtaining fresh orders. This is unfavourably influencing the ship plate and angle iron department, which have hitherto been fairly kept going.

HARVEST FESTIVALS.—Harvest thanksgiving services where held at tt Thomas' Church, Stockton, on Sunday. Very little effort had been made in the way of church decoration ; but the congregations were large, and the services more than usually attractive.—Large congregation a again attended St. Tames' Church, when the harvest decorations had been retained in order to gratify the desires of many who were unable to obtain admis,ion to the church at the previous services.  IST. GEORGE'S PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, ST3OK, TON.—Special bervices in connection with the laying of the memorial stone of bt.

It was decided that when the statement of expenses incurred in the opposition to the Stockton and Middlesbrough Water Bill was received, it should be referred to the committee appointed on this question. It was decided that it was not expedient to appoint district committees, as provided for by the Act 28th :and 29th Viet., cap. 121, sec. 23.  Row AT THE STATION HOTEL.—At the Stockton Police Court, on Thursday, before the Mayer, E. Henderson, J. H. Wren, and J. S. Byers, Esq.-, Mr John Hunter McCann, who was represented by Mr Fawcett, charged John Pickering with drunkenness and refusing to quit his premises. The defendant asked for drink, and was very abusive and insulting, and tstruok him on the ear. McCann granted that when five yards outside the house, he pushed Pickering down and he fell. Jno. Hutchinson, a railway porter, deposed to being present when Pickering came in. and was supplied with half a glass of whiskey. He then ordered another half glass of whiskey and some beer for the railway porters who were present. McCann refused to fill him. McCann then ordered him te leave the house. He did not ref use in words, but kept his position when McCann came round and led him down stairs. Pickering then struck McCann as before stated, and McCann pushed him down. Mr Bolsover appeared for Pickering. He stated for the defence that Pickering when asked to go out he at ones did so, he did not strike McCann at all, but when on the door step McCann came to him and gave him such a violent push that he fell heavily on his arm and dislocated his shoulder. Mr Bolsover then called the defendant, who supported those statements, also Thomas Pi Acting and Thomas Gotten, moulders, who substantially corroborated the same statement—that Pickering came down stairs by himself and was on the doorstep when McCann pulled him violently down after deliberating for some time. Fined—Pickering for being drunk and riotous, 2s and Costs; McCann, Is and costs.  COUNTY REVISION AT STOCKTON.—On Tuesday Mr J. C. Heath revised the list of persons entitled to vote in the election of members for the Southern Division of the county of Durham, in the Stockton district, at the Town Hall, Stockton. Mr Thomas Eden, agent for the Liberal Association, with Mr J. Watson appeared for the Liberals, and Mr Robert Richmond for the Conservatives. The party objections were all made by the Liberals, and about twenty Conservatives wets struck off. About forty claims were also made for Liberal votes, against four by the ormosite party, all of which were allowed. In the Wolviston district a man named Thomas Scotson had written to the overseer to erase his name from the list without giving any reason, though legally qualified. The Revising Barrister ruled that a voter could not resign his position any more than a member of Parliament,and retained the name on the list. In the Elton district William Salmon, chemist, Stockton, and John Salmon, farmer, f Elton, claimed to vote as joint tenants of land occupied at Elton. Mr Watson opposed the claim. It appeared that William was bondman for John, who was rented at glai a year, but that he had no interest in the laud beyond his liability as surety, and that nothing but a verbal a:reernent existed from year to year. The claim of John was allowed, and that of his brother rejected. —The name of George Coates, of Longnewton, WWI objected to, he having left the place upwards of a year, and being now a voter at Darlington. This slams was struck out.—A case adjourned from Bishop Auckland was decided, in which the Presbyterian minister claimed to vote, on the ground that the house he occupied wet held by him as part of his salary. Mr Heath was of opinion that it was such a claim as could not give a county qualification, and disallowed it. EVANGELISTIC SERVICES IN STOCKTON.—According to previous announcement, Mr Scroggie (a Scotch evangelist), commenced a series of tpecnal religious services in Stockton on Sunday last. The first meeting was at 8 a.m. in the Exchange Hall, Fein:: designed for Christians only, There vra.2 a large number present, and on the platform were a number of dissenting ministers of the town. The meeting commenced by the usual exercises of worship. Prayer being offered by the Rev. Mr Bogue (Presbyterian), Mr Scroggie then proceeded in a forcible and impressive manner to deliver an address on the power, the influence, and the personality of the Holy Spirit, with special refeience to his work in the conversion of the world to Christ, and his power and personality in fitting believers for a Godly life. Mr Scroggit's style of addrees is eminently clear and logical, and when he introduces an illustration it is to the point and adds force to the subject in hand, which, added to his strong sense of conviction, is well calculated to convey information and conviction to the minds of his hearers. Mr Scroggie again addressed crowded audiences in the Exchange Hall on Sunday afternoon and evening, and is announcal for every evening for some timo to collie. We understand that on Saturday a bill was issued, sigueil by the whole of the dissenting ministers of the town, expressing their sympathy with Mr Scroggie and his work, and urging the membeis of their respective congregations to attend the Sunday morning meeting. A number of congregational meetings have been given up for the time so as further to facilitate their attendance.  THE ROPER! NUISANCE AGAIN.-WHO IS  TO BLAME?  'Sin,—l am sorry to write you again, hut after what took place at the Council meeting, held on Tuesday night last, I cannot help saying something. After they had got all the business arising out of the minutes dune (which only occupied three-quarters of an hour), Mr Alderson aked why the Corporation had not got possession of the land for the roads through the ropery, and he referred to persons writing to the press, as showing that the outsiders were getting anxious about having a mid that they could walk on without getting to the boot tops in water, and he was told that he we out of order. (He admitted that), but seeing that they were to have hdd possession on the 20th of September he desired to know why they had not got it. when Mr Faber said if persons write to the Fres., let them get their answers from the press. Now, Sir, I think that this was anything but courteous to Mr Alderson, and not very respectful to the public generally. Mr Alderson may have been out of order as a matter of form, but seeing that they were told at the Council meeting, held Sept. 7th, that they would get possession on the 20th, which they did not, I think Mr Alderson deserved a more careful answer to his question. P.s.—Where are the representatives of our North-West Ward. They seem to care nothing about the Ropery ? They will talk about it in November. —Yours respectfully, R. BEADMAN, "

"" HASILLD"" 0/7103, FRIDAY, 6 P.ll.  MYSTERIOUS SHOOTING CASE AT  HARTLEPOOL.  A YOUNG MAN SERIOUSLY INJURED.  A young man, named Payne, son of the landlady of the Lord Clifton Hotel, Hartlepool, is lying in the hospital of that town with two bullet wounds in his head. The young man was formerly employed by the Tramway Company, but has been out of work for some time, and it is supposed that in a fit of despondency he attempted to take his life. When found he was lying on the headland protection wall in a semi-unconscious eondition. The injured man was taken to the hospital by a friend. A statement has since been made that he was shot from behind, and the young man himself alleged this to be the fact. When questioned this morning, he repeated the statement, remarking "" I was struck from behind."" The police, to whom the matter was only reported last night, believe, however, that the injuries were self-inflicted. Dr. Morgan, the house surgeon, who has charge of the case, naturally declines to give any decided opinion as to how the wounds were inflicted, but he considers the injuries dangerous, a portion of the skull behind the right ear, where the wounds are situate, having been fractured. The mother of the young man is totally opposed to the theory that her son attempted to commit suicide, and declares that his mind was not affected in any way. The police have now the matter in hand, and Sergeant Sweeting is making enquiries with the view of clearing up the mystery whia at present appears to surround the case.  THE DANGERS OF ELECTRICITY. DESTRUCTION OF AN EDISON STATION. There is much excitement at St. Louis in America over electric lighting wire accidents. A heavy rainstorm recently wrought considerable havoc among the electric wires, and it was not until after midnight that they were brought ;uto proper working order. At about eight o'clock on Wednesday evening an electric light wire fell to the ground near a street corner. A few moments later aMr and Mrs Smith and a. little dog passed the corner. The dog touched the wire, and was killed in a moment. Mrs Smith ran to the dog, and not seeing the wire stepped on it. She was thrown some distance, and fell unconscious. Her busband sprang to pick her up, and received a severe shock, but was not rendered insensible. 'Mrs Smith was restored to consciousness by a physician, but had a narrow escape from death. A crowd collected, and a man coming in contact with the wire was knocked insensible. A fireman rushed to his rescue, and received a very severe shock. The first victim was so badly hurt that he was sent to the City Hospital. ' A horse was killed by stepping on a fallen wire in another part of the city, and several other minor accidents occurred. The down-town station of the Edison Electric Lighting Company of New York caught fire yesterday morning, and was completely destroyed, entailing aloes of 100,000 dollars upon the company. The station occupied two four-storey buildings, and supplied electricity to 18,000 incandescent lamps. The fire started in the dynamo room, but how it broke out is unknown It is inferred that it may have been caused by sparks from a dynamo. It was the intention of the company to rebuild the station in the spring, making it 40 reproof. "

Although it is probable that the condemned American murderer Kemmler will be able to obtain a further postponement of his fate, the authorities, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of the State that execution by electricity is not unconstitutional, have thought it advisable to get their apparatus in order. Controversy has been raging since Kemmler was first condemned as to whether it would be really possible to kill a man with certainty by means of an electric current, and the negative was urged fiercely by certain writers, even in face of the numerous deaths caused by accidental contact with electric lighting wires. After Tuesday's etperiments in the State prison at Auburn, however, there ought to be no further dispute on the subject. The apparatus, which sooner or later will be used upon Kemmler, was fitted to a horse and subsequAntly to a call. A current of 1,000 volts was then turned on, and in each case the animal was instantly killed. "

STOCETON BOARD OF HEAL 'lli. The usual fortnightly meeting of the Urban Sanitary Authority for the Borough of Stockton was held on Friday evening, in the Council Chambers, Town Hall, Stockton. Present: G. M. Watson, Esq., Mayor, Messrs A. C. Knowles, R. Jackson, G. F. Smith, H. Smith, J. Brown, J. F. Craggs, IL Wilson, J. H. Clough, E. Henderson, J. Brotherten, J. Farquarhson, J. Richardson, J. H. Wren, H. G. Faber, clerk; G. Edmunds, surveyor; A. E. H' Trotter, medical officer; J. Eccles and T. R. Yorke, nuisance inspectors. Minutes of last meeting were read and confirmed. .  The following was the Surveyor's report:— July 17.—GENTLEMEN,—I would recommend that an agricultural pipe drain be laid along the foundation of the back walls of the houses belonging to Jackson Prince, in M.,rris-sticet, the drain trench to be filled with rubble, and communicate with the sewer in the hack street, the down pipes to cornmuuic,ate with the. said drain. My attention hay. • in;.e, been called to a notice served upon the Town Clerk, by the Rural Sanitary Authority to abate a nuisance in a certain stream called Lustrum beck, which, said notice alleges, is caused by the act and default of the Corporation. 1 therefore deemed it my duty to at once report thereon, and in doing so I cannot but think that the Rural Sanitary Authority, to say the least, has been misled in this matter, or it would never have ordered issue of the notice, if it had been made aware that fully one half of the nuisance is caused by its own act and default in :Ilowing the Norton sewage to be discharged into the said stream. If any person disputes my statement, let them visit the huge seething cauldron situate on the b .nks of the stream at a distance of a few bundled yards to the east of Norton Bridge, which contains over 50,000 gallons of sewage matter, with a surface of near 1,200 superficial feet daily exposed to the hot rays of the sun, where the pestiferous stuff is bubbling and undergoing decomposition before finally entering the stream, in which proc ,ss it is greatly facilitated by the action of the re,use from the Norton Brewery; and I very much question whether such another place exists for the mauufacture of fever-breeding mal!. rift where there is the lewd semblance of a sanitary authority. I have inspected the whole length of the beck to its outfall near Newport, and I do not think it is worse theta it has been in former dry seasons; however, it is no use denying that a serious nuisance exists, and that sooner or later it will have to be dealt with; but it opens up a very large question, iz., the ultimate disposal of the sewage of the whole borough, which, considering the very unsatisfactory state of the sewage difficulty generally, I think the time has hardly yet arrived for taking the matter into serious consideration' unless the Corporation were compelled to do so. It is entirely a question for the Corporation to decide, and should they decide in the affirmative, I would recommend that ; the best advice that can be obtained be taken before adoptiug any of the methods now in vogue for the disposal of the town sewage. I would suggest that • instead of bandying notices about., the two authorities job' in equal shares in the expense of deodorising powder to be used freely in the beck, as far as Portrack Bridge awl to the before-mentioned cauldron during the present derives:her, if the Tees • Conservancy Commissioners will permit it to be ; dene. I think it will do no harm to the fish in the Tees, as the flow of the tide is now cut off, and if the powder contains anything deleterious, it will be , spent before r liching the river. - After some conversation, it was resolved to give L the Rural Sanitaty Authority notice to cleanse their portion of the beck as well.

Soma years ago a detachment of the Royal Artillery were stationed at Queenstoa Heighte, Ontario, during the winter. It is needless to say that there the cold is =oh more severe than in England, and this particular winter was rather above the average in rigour. It was Christmas live ; darkness had sot in, and the men were enjoying themselves in various ways indoors,the sentries being almost the only persons to be seen outside. In one of the rooms sat a sergeant with his wife and a few friends chatting before a huge log tire piled up the capacious chimney, and which, by its bright and strong blaze, rendered any other light useless. Before the fire, too, lying snugly at his master's feet, was a splendid specimen of a Newfoundland dog, which was a great favourite with the family ett account of his many admirable qualities. Be was white, but with a large black patch en one shoulder, and hence he was called ""Spot."" The dog was gentle, true, and afTectienate among his master's family, but kept himself very distant from strangers. He bad a great aversion to go out with anyone save his master, and though the men frequently tried to get Spot to accompany them their walks, he was never known to go with atty of them except on this particular occasion. In the course of the evening some milk was wanted, and a soldier was called and sent to get some, with injunctions to ""look sharp"" back. To the surprise of everyone, when the man went to the door Spot rose and followed him out, without any call or invitation, and it being so remarkable a circumstance no one opposed his intention. The man had a walk of about fifteen minutes to where he was to get the milk, and had to cross a deep ravine on his way. So off he set over the frozen snow, Spot trotting beside him. He arrived there safely, purchased the milk, and was setting off back again, when a comrade met him, and, alas! persuaded him to take a glass of ardent spirits. Another and another dram was taken to keep up the season and keep out the cold, and then he started fairly for home. After gaining the cold, open air he soon began to feel a numbness and an irre.tistible desire to lie down. He reached the bottom of the ravine safely, Spot still beside him,but theaseent was beyond his power, and, after staggering a few stepe, he sank down insensible in the snow. The sergeant and his friends were still sitting round the fire, and beginning to wonder at the messenger's protracted absence, when they suddenly heard a scratching at the door. It was opened, and in walked Spot, alone, and , with a very troubled countenance. No particular notice was at first taken of him, as it was thought that, tired of his self-imposed task, he had left the man, and returned. But Spot was restless. He sat down just inside the door, whined slightly, and drew himself by slow degrees nearer his master. At last, laying hold of the sergeant's trousers, he gave a slight pull, looked up in his face, and uttered a protracted howl. This immediately caused attention to be directed to him, and it was then conjectured that something had befallen the man. The sergeant rose, called two or three men, and made towards the door, whither he was prezeded by Spot jumping about and showing strong manifestations of joy. The dog led them straight off to the ravine, running on before, and seeming to beckon them to follow him. Descending the side at the place indicated by him, they soon came upon the half. frozen soldier, lying where be fell, his broken jug beside him, and his body being rapidly Covered by the fallen snow. His clothes, too, bore unmistakable marks of the dog's teeth, showing that the noble animal had done all he could to drag him along, and. finding himself unequal to the task, had at once set off to procure help. To raise the poor fellow upon their shoulders and to hurry back again was the work of a few minutes. Life was still in him, and with warmth and other restoratives lie began to revive; but it was some time before he entirely got over the effects of that dangerous sleep on qucenston Hill. He ever after bore a great aft, ..tion for his four-footed preserver, and, still better, was led to give up drink altogether, and became $ Christian. His escape from certain death also caused him to think  rierously, and v•as productive of good fruit. r his discharge lie became a town gni. f.ionary, and when last I heard of him he v,r labouring earnestly in that capacity. o•-)t lived to a good old age, and man/ . .nge stories are told of his bravery, i.e,,)tion, and affection. —"" UNCLE JOHN'S ANECDOTES.""

Dr. Nees sel.eted as his text 2nd Samuel, xxiii qa., 5 verse, ""Although my house be not so b God: yet be bath made with me everlasting covemant."" These, said the ocher, were amongst the last words of David, ose feelings on his death-bed were mingled. bad bright prospects, but gloomy memories. IVII3 right beyond, but behind many things l been left undone. God forbid that say of hearers should in their tarot hours look around, pee their children living without hope and g without God. David's life was full of tea and mistak, s, and his death was shadowY unhappy memories, yet glorious withal the hope of the everlasting covenant. Had sat jat 'r Had he ruled righteously in the of Ce 3 f He trusted his heaters; would be to look bark on life with more satisfaction David. His conduct with triab was not . He bad committed the grierourp folly of her,.. Israel, to awe neighbouriug nations O his strength, forgetting that the Lord no need of numbers. The I hail visited the conuequence of the last ore on the people, and the former on David he revolt of Absalom. It was just such an ypip , David made on h's death-bad that y ..c pre,. nt would one day make. Did I think of this? In commercial life there two *I ~-es. theme who thought of others ob.t.t.t:e4 the golden rule, and those who only ght e! .hselves. The Istter may prosper, Lhe r.rarelt may honour them if they were r...ns eb.,llgh. There was no place where tem iperht be RO easily secured as in the ~ 1, t they saw the children of good its eane to grief sometimes. David's was story, rarely equalled in the family history ngs. But even in the present dog many its found their houses, ""not so with God."" ? Pertly no doubt through parental billy mistakes. Let them took at patriarchs. Isaac loved Loa'  Oldii  aideted!  Rachel loved Jacob, and through her love for her boy deceived the fa,her. What then, could they expect of the child ? Jacob fled to Labatt. Laban watt a hari, grasping, unscrupulous man. He wanted to make the most of his two daughters, and hey demised him. In the present day merry palmate were cold, and Nought to make a market of their family; if they did they moot not be surprised on their death-bed ti find their house ""not with God."" Let them look at Jacob's family. Jacob loved I Joseph more than his brethren. He made for him a coat of many colours. He excited their jealousy, and on the first opportunity they got rid of him—sold him ae a slave, and if parente showed partiality for one child over anther, they meet not be surprised if their house was ""not with God."" David was a bd.), man, his life was much occupied with the cares of sovereignty, but he still found some time in which to exercise some of the duties of a father, for we read that he went down to ""bless hiss house."" Hod he gone down a httle ottener it would have been all the better. He (the preacher) urged frthere to leave not their homes noblest by their presence. Business cares may occupy thim, but no businees should cause a man ti neglect his home. It would be little comfort for him in his latter days to leave his children living without hope and dying without God. Tee condition of David's family was due partly no doubt to polyaamy, each mother was anxious for and schemed for the advancement of her offepring, and they saw the result. He o mnselleit Christian mot here to take this to heart. Thir state of David's family was also due to the result of parental sins. There wail the crime against Uriah, the consequence, of which was the enactment M a similar crime in David's own family, where the brother ruined the sister. It was possible that similar judicial visitations occurred in families to-day, but he would not stay to inquire. There was more than we thought in hereditary tastes and taints. They could see the inflame° of bad example in David's family. They would say that the fret of the father suffering for his sins would be a warning to his son, hut it never was, the son wished to gain the experience for himself. With all our boastid advancement in civilization the fact remained that the wiles which led young men away in the daya of Solomon did the mime now. Let fathers Mow the example of a good life to their children, a good life io better than all the t ilk in the wo.td. The son, it might be said, of a bad fai her would see the evil of his parents' ways, hut he would like also to see the evil of his own He longed fig the experience. But there was a bright side to David's thoughts en his death bed, they were bright with the hope of immortality, Vie everlasting covenant. To David it meant the coming of Christ Through the long vistas of ages he could see the unsprinkled altar. But they could look back on that altar through the Vinas of nearly two thousand years, and recogniza the covenant made with David at belonging to the whole human family.

Robe' ts's (of Liverpool, the Mormon-English "" endyel opedia,"") reply to my letter. published in a recent' issue of the Leader. He says a copy of your pa por. Mr Editor, containing an article on Mormon ion, written by Mr A. D. Bolitho, has been sent in 0 by a friend in South Wales, and as there is one thing in it that is infinitely amusing to y our readers, I venture to point it out, and which is as follows: —""The Hon. C. C. Bean, EldeT Williams's first mighty defender if the "" liccutions and murderous church of Mormon/. was made to say, in a late issue of the Leader, by Mr Eoliths', that he did not know whether urn et the Utah' practice polygamy or not, instead oi he ditl not know whether or not the Indians in 'Otah practice it."" I have no time, sir, to waste w?lfh your correspondent in 'cavilling eve r empty words. Any fool can male an and himself by , adopting his mode of argument. Why .does be not try cod refute the terrible indictment that hen been made against the Mormons or La tterdny Saints, if he tel-hei to ""bold the ""huge seminal and sanguinary doctrine"" of the Morrill:Ms t lam afraid that he is something like the dog that was croesing bridge with i piece of meat in his mouth, and seeing the shadow of It in the water he dropped the meat and madly rushed after the shadow. I cm mature your correspondent that however amusing Mormonism might be to him, the Swansea public look npoo it with disgust mid disdain. , Your correspondent says that Mrilolitho tries to contradict the statement of the Hon. C. C. Bean relative to the temperance of the Mormons, and eaye :—""Three part. of the public. houses of Utah are kept by the leaders, of the church, from a bishop down to an effier. That statement, Mr editor, r stamp as an infamous falsehood. I was rested among the Mormon people, and from my kuowledge of the world Mr Bolitho will look in vain for a more mope. rate people.""

I suppoes I muse be very careful what I say about this gentleman's authority, or he may put the ""closure"" on me. You kno Mr EdiMr, defy do do this on °Minr. ions members. Your Mormon writer asks if MI Bolitho can threw aside this testimony of Mr Smoky's, as be attempted' In that of the thoo C. C. Bean? My answer is yes, and without much trouble too. It is impassible for men, on. flying visit to the Mormons,' to find out their diabolical and hellish character; you must live among them to do this. Inusgioe, if you can a burglar who broke into • braise, and stolen I goods, as soon as he saw a policeman coming I bring out the stolen property, and putting it where the offioer could see it; ynu know he would not be such • fool. The Mormons, also, , are a shrewd people, and are over on the look oat for strangers, and to see that such persons see only the (satanic in reality) eanctimonions , part of Mormoni.tn, ao that wan they return to their own country they might give them a I good name: therefore, the Mormons' greatest art is to be moat gracious to travellers. rh. y bow such men into their city, andlthow them out ef their city. We cannat receive such statements of Metiers. Barclay and Rbbinson's, as they are ""not diet ,torielly,"" eopecially when you consider the following evidence, which is given by official witnesses, and which oontradicta the above named gentlemen's statements. The Mormon public houses in Utah are kept by the leaders of the church, from &bishop down to an elder.

""lOLANTHE"" AT THE PRINCE OF WALES THEATRE. Messrs Gilbert & Sullivan's latest comic opera, "" lolanthe,"" has taken the dramatic world by storm this week in Blackpool. It is a splendid production, and nothing has ever yet been placed better on the stage of the Prince of Wales Theatre. Every night the house is crowded, and we cannot but congratulate Mr. Sergenson on the hit he has made in securing 80 good a company ' and so splendid a piece for our Blackpool season. The plot of "" lolanthe "" is a very taking one. The Lord Chancellor, supported by a whole host of peers of the realm, take a prominent part in it, arrayed in their most august robes. A whole host of beautiful fairies also play a distinguished part in the piece. In his youth the Lord Chancellor falls in love with lolanthe, the prettiest of all the fairies, and they are wedded. For this disregard of all the laws of fairyland, the Queen of the Fairies condemns lolanthe to death ; but on (the petition of lolanthe's companions her sentence is commuted to one of banishment for life. lolanthe takes 013 her abode at the bottom of a stream or brook; and is lost to her husband—not then, of course, the Lord Chancelbr—who believes her to be dead. lolanthe has a son—immortal, like the fairies, but only above the waist. Below the waist he is only too human. This son is ""Strephon,"" who falls in love with Phillis, a ward of the Court of Chancery. The Lord Chancellor declares against his ward marrying Strephon, a mere shepherd. But the girl sticks to her lover the while. At the end of 25 years, on another petition being presented by the fairies, lolanthe is pardoned, and reappears from the bottom of; the brook. Being immortal, like the rest of the fairies, she looks as young as ever. Here the intricacy of the story comes in. Strephon and his mother meet, the son looking his twentyfive years, and the mother sweet seventeen. Phillis catches sight of Strephon caressing his mother, avoids her lover in a fit of jealousy, and is almost induced to marry either the Lord Chancellor or one of the Peers. The end of it all is that lolanthe informs the mortals of her fairy-hood, tells the Lord• Chancellor that his wife is still living, and his consent is at last gained to the union of Strephon and lolanthe. The cast is an excellent one, Miss Fanny Harrison is well fitted both by nature and art to act the role of a robust fairy-queen. No better Lord Chancellor on the stage could be found anywhere than Mr. Frank Thornton. As for Mr. George Mailer, he performs the part of the grenadier guardsman on sentry to perfection. Mr. Frederici's "" Strephon "" is an admirable performance, and so is 1 Mrs Laura Clement's Mills. The songs introduced are excellently rendered. The dresses are in keeping with the period and character, and alto. gether the company and the theatre are to be complimented on the splendid manner in which the opera goes off. It is not often that we in Blackpool have the chance of seeing so brilliant a piece in our theatres, and consequently the present opportunity should not be missed. Next week Mr. C. Dornton's ""Two Orphans"" Company, with Mr. Wm. Rignold in his original character of ""Jacques,"" will play at the Prince of Wales Theatre.  MONS. RIVIERE'S BAND AT THEI WINTER GARDENS. The special attraction this week at the Winter Gardens is Mons. Rivieres orchestral band. For two seasons this famous wielder of the baton has given most of the best modern selections in a style which could not be surpassed anywhere. The advent of Mons. Riviere and his corps of instrumentalists drew a large audience to the Pavilion on Monday afternoon, and again in the evening. Notwithstanding the disadvantege that several members of the band only ""just arrived"" that very morning in Blackpool, the ""first appearance,"" more in the character of a rehearsal than anything else, showed the band off to great advantage, and the consequence was great and well-deserved applause. The selections were of the popular class, and calculated to bring out the many good qualities of the band, both individually and collectively. In the evening the band was in good form, and interpreted the various items on the programme in excellent style. On Tuesday and Wednesday the performances of the band were equally meritorious, and evoked the warm appreciation of the large audiences. Now that Mons. Riviere has once again taken his place at the head of the Winter Garden concerts, we may expect a continuous supply of the best rendering of the best masters. We may be sure that the talented composer and conductor will spare no pains both to interest and instruct his audiences. We take it that the high-class music, both vocal and instrumental, performed at the Winter Gardens, and elsewhere in Blackpool during the season proper, is tending largely to cultivate the taste of our inland friends who come in shoals to Blackpool not only for the sake of health and recreation, but also for the purpose of listening to the brilliant music like that provided at the Winter Gardens. There is no question that our season orchestral bands have largely refined the musical taste of our visiting public. Last night Mons. Riviere introduced a special programme, the novelty of which was that it showed the proficiency of the artistes as soloists. The following was the programme : Violin Solo—"" Ballad and Polonaise"" Vieuxtemps Mr. A. Payne Flute Solo—"" Remembranza Napolitana "" Paggi Mr. H. Piddock Oboe Solo—"" Si j'etais roi "" Leduc Mr. J. Murray -""The Promised Land"" F. L. Moir Mr. R. Hollins  Song—'  .. Mozart  Horn Solo—"" Romanza "" Mr. F. Catchpole Violoncello Solo—( A )""Piece No. 1."" (B) "" Arlequin"" Bruneau, Popper Mr. :4. Farnow Cornet Solo—Polka ""Leviathan"" Mr. McGrath Harp Si—"" Dense des Sylphe"" Gadefrey Madame Frost Bassoon Solo—"" Fantaisie Variee ""Winterbottom Mr. J. Anderson Clarionette Solo—"" sth Air Variee "" Mr. H. Snelling ""Harry Bluff"" Mr. Redfern Hollins Piccolo Solo—Fantasie ""Echoes des Bois""llamare Signor Bertoncini Euphonium Solo—"" Senchutz "" Mr. H. Jackson The performance in each case was so excellent as to call forth most demonstrative applause. To-day (Friday) and to-morrow (Saturday), are the last two days of the engagement of Herr Dobler and the Eugene Troupe of flying gymnasts. On Saturday and Monday next, the first grand extra concerts will be given, when the great English prima donna, Madame Marie Rose will appear each evening, in conjunction with Mr. Redfern Hollins and Mr. G. H. Snazelle. During the present year Madame Marie Rose has accepted a number of en. gagements to sing in conceits and oratorios in the principal cities of Great Britain and Ireland ; and she has been also engaged to sing at the Birmingham Festival, where she will create several important works, the chief of which will be Gade's "" Psyche "" and Sir Julius B.enedict's "" Graziella."" Madame Marie Rose first appeared in public in 1865, having been specially selected by Auber to sing a Benedictus in the chapel of the Tuileries before the Emperor and Empress of the French, in celebration of the Prince Imperial's birthday. For nearly ten years the name of Marie Roze has been prominently before the people of France, America, and Great Britain, associated in all minds with purity, gentleness, and devotion to the causes of humanity and art. In both hemispheres her accomplishments as an actress, her talents as a singer, and her many personal graces have made her beloved and admired by the public, the professional critics, and all musical connoisseurs. With the exception of Jenny Lind DO other artists ever went to the -United States and won such a secure position in the hearts of the American people as Marie Roze.

JOHN AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION.  Last night the Mayor (H. Hall, Esq., J.P.,) distributed the certificates to the successful candidates in the recent examinations, at a meeting held in the Victoria Hall, Winter Gardens. Amongst others on the platform were Dr. V. A. Wartenberg, Rev. S. Y. R Bradshaw, Rev. T. G. Johnson, Dr. Anderson (Poulton), Mr. R. Handley, Mr. Parry, Dr. Vernon, Mr. Bamber, Mr. John Taylor, secretary, &c. , The MAYOR, in opening the proceedings, said there were societies and societies ; but he believed the St. John Ambulance Society could show a better reason for its existence than many other societies. It had for its object the alleviation of the sickness and suffering of the human race. (Hear, hear.) No society had a nobler object than that. As for the ladies who joined these classes, although they did not wear uniform nor attract attention in the market place, yet they were really and truly sisters of mercy. (Hear, hear.) The members of these classes wera trained to give assistance when first wanted. Many a person had the most creditable desire to be useful to his fellow-eratures, but failed by not doing the right thing at the right time. (Hear, hoar.) This society was, in his opinion, nothing less than a species of life assurance society, and he went on to express the belief that thousands of lives had been sacrificed for want of good nursing. (Applause.) Mr. JOHN TAYLOR (secretary) read the annual report, which presented a most satisfactory state of affairs in connection with the society, the strength of the classes already formed being as follows: Blackpool male class, 25; female, 27; South Shore, male class, 13; female 25; Poulton male class, 14; female 11; total 115. The Rev. S. Y. B. BRADSAAW, vicar of South Shore, in moving ""That this meeting fully appreciates the objects of the St. John Ambulance Association, and considers them worthy of hearty support,"" said the question involved very much concerned the whole public mind. All who were placed in situations of authority in our various municipalities could find nothing more to the advantage of communities than anything that promoted the health of the people. (Hear, hear.) In particular this society merited the hearty support of the people of Blackpool, for its aims were the most unselfish that could actuate any one. A desire to do good to one's fellow-creatures was the noblest aim any person could have, and this society gave direction and opportunity to such an aim. (Hear, hear.) Those who attended these classes were so many unselfish helpers in the great army that endeavoured to battle with human pain and misery. (Hear, hear.) The members of these classes were not striving to encroach upon duties that did not be long to them, but to step in and afford help. in cases of emergency. And here Mr. Bradshaw instanced the case of the first officer killed in the Egyptian war, as a case in which, if one present had had as much training as the members of the Blackpool classes, the officer's life would have been saved. ( Hear, hear.) This society appealed for strong support on the ground of great ability and great unselfishness, and he was glad to say that it was receiving support all over the country. It was something for the members of this society to share in the labours of a great and highly honourable profession. (Hear, hear.) Especially would he urge the young men of Blackpool to join the classes, and devote some portion of their spare time to so good a work. As for the ladies, they were naturally good nurses, but the training they received in these classes would make them all the more efficient in cases of need. (Applause.) Mr. HANDLEY seconded in a brief, but effective  speech. On being put to the vote, the motion was carried. The MAYOR then proceeded to distribute the certificates, according to the following list of successful candidates who had passed the recent examinations : Blackpool. Males—Mr. C. T. Ward  „ Josiah F.

Lester  The Rev. T. G. JOHNSON, in moving a vote of thanks to Dr. Wartenberg, said he had no doubt that many from ignorance or prejudice, viewed with disfavour the St. John Ambulance Association. If such persons would take the trouble to study the syllabus of lectures with unbiassed minds, they would be forced to admit its practical utility. They were taught the structure and functions of the human body ; the position of the principal arteries and veins, where, and how circulation of the blood could be arrested ; the signs of fractures and disloeations ; and the necessary aid in such cases, first assistance to those bitten by rabid animals, and the immediate treatment of the apparently drowned ; improved mode of lifting and carrying the injured ; also how to deal with burns, scalds, and poisons. Often in the hours of serious reflection, he had pictured himself in immediate contact with a ruptured blood vessel, or a lacerated wound, standing by, unable to render the needed assistance, while the crimson current of life ebbed away. He was a firm believer in the doctrine that DO man lived to himself. He pitied the inhuman being to whom self was the centre and circumference of every thought, word, and deed, whose narrow soul was so chained to his own interests that the groans of the outside world evoked no sympathetic feelings in his selfish heart. Usefulness produced the sweetest music on the harp of a thousand strings, and awoke the symphonies of heaven. (Hear, hear.) He had no ambition whatever to assume the functions of a doctor, nor to test his ability to staunch a bleeding wound, or to splint a broken limb; yet, he was no longer troubled with those oft recurring visions of condemnation. He had studied with diligenee the able and simplified lectures of Dr. Wartenberg, and possessed a degree of confidence that he could, if necessary, apply them to I practical advantage. (Hear, hear.) The ladies, in addition to the points already mentioned, were taught particulars as to the temperature, the ventilation, and the disinfection of a sick room ; also how to prevent the spread of contagious and infectious diseases. He once heard an excellent doctor say that many children lived solely because they would not be killed ; meaning thereby that mothers were often absolutely ignorant how to nurture infant life. He thought a similar thing might be truthfully stated respecting the sick and the afflicted. I They were placed in a small room, minus any outlet for the impure atmosphere to escape by, and I hence, unless either by a miracle of mercy inter. , I vened, the sufferers became the victims of blood. poisoning, or nature having endowed them with an iron organism, they were able to bid defiance to atmospheric influence. When leaving such rooms with pallid faces and trembling nerves he had wished that he had been a doctor whose commands would be obeyed, and whose behests would be respected, so that ailing humanity might at least have fresh air. Disease was often spread from family to family by selfishness, carelessness, and ignorance. Dr. Wartenberg, by his self-denying labours, was circulating a practical knowledge on these important subjects which could not fail to effect much good. He merited the thanks of every man, woman, and child in this district. He had always held Dr. Wartenberg in high esteem ; but his respect for him was increased tenfold by witnessi thisitruly philanthropic work in Blackpool and neighbourhood. No golden voice summoned him to this work. No promised honours were appended to his self-denying labours. He honoured Dr. Wartenberg, and every man in whose breast throbbed practical compassion for their suffering race. (Hear, hear.) It gave him the very greatest pleasure, therefore, to propose that the very best thanks of the meeting be given to Dr. Wartenberg for gratuitously devoting his scientific knowledge, science, and experience to the social and physical well-being of the inhabitants of this locality. (Cheers.) Mr. BAMBER seconded in a few words. The CHAIRMAN, in putting the resolution to the vote, said such local patriotism as Dr. IVartenberg had displayed in connection with this society marked him out as a prominent and useful citizen. (Applause.) If Dr. Wartenberg had not come for"

L. 5.,"" on the subject of a crematorium for Blackpool. I quite agree with the suggestions made by the writer. I think it is a reflection upon our civilisation and vaunted progress and enlightenment that we should still have such a primitive and altogether objectionable method of disposing of our dead. It is no mark of affection for loved ones, who I have been taken from us, to consign their last remains to the bowels of the earth, there to go I through the horrible process of decomposition I and putrefaction. The Englishman is in many respects exceedingly conservative, and in some highly sentimental. I can well conceive that many people would stand aghast at the bare suggestion of cremation, and that they would countenance the old-fashioned system of burial without ever a thought as to the consequences of their act. I agree with your correspondent that there is a great probability that owing to the insanitary smells and the contamination of natural moisture, much disastrous sickness is occasioned ; and my view is that while we owe every possible respect to the dead, that respect must not be carried out at the expense of the health of the living. It is infinitely more important to consider our duty to the latter than it is to hedge about with what are in • great measure purely sentimental, shall I say misguided, ideas as to our obligations and duties to the mortal remains of those who are no more. Wnat with our increasing population and the greater demands for the cultivation of every available inch of land, it seems that the country will era long be bound to seriously face this problem of the burial of the dead. And why prolong it, until we reach a suicidal condi ion of things? If the people have sentimental objections to it. the people want educating, and it is the duty of all those who are alive to the shortcomings and dangers of the present system to take their share in dispelling prevailing prejudices against any change in this sacred rite. The old Romans and other nations in those days, I believe, were not strangers to cremation and even archaologists occasionally come across urns containing the long-preserved ashes of the people of other days. This is a subject which requires ventilation, and the moment we can begin to open the eyes of the present generation to the evils and the abominations of the present system, then will the light of an advanced civilisation scatter the darkness of past prejudice and foolish regard for a system which ought to have disappeared with all the other objectionable features of what we sometimes have the temerity to designate as the dark days.  In taking up this attitude I give place to no ' one in my regard for our sacred duty to the dead. Neither am I unable to rise to the . beauty of Gray's lines, wherein he pictures the touching beauty and tender associations connected with the village churchyard: "" Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude fore-fathers of the hamlet sleep."" From this point of view there may be little to be said as to the evils of our present cystem of interment. We appreciate the sentiment, which is a most beautiful one, and we drink in the inspiration and the beauty of this charming pastoral picture. But the sentiment which . throws a halo round the cemetery and the confines of a large populous town is robbed of much of its eloquence, much of its beauty, much of lie higher inspiration, when we are brought face to face with the fact that that cemetery crowded as it is with the remains of the dead is a positive menace and a serious danger to the health of the entire community beside it. I maintain, sir, that no system of sanitation could obviate the evil, and while on this point I may say that I have very little faith in the success of the operations of the Cemetery Committee, who, I see from your last issue, are about to consider the advisability of improving the sanitary arrangements of the drainage of our own little cemetery. This is an imperative duty, of course, so far as they are concerned, but would it not be a thousand times better to introduce a system which would be fraught with no such contaminating influences; and which would give rise to no such dangers. I would urge upon your readers, sir, that this is a most serious matter, and I would respectfully point out that those fathers and mothers and others who are at the head of the ocmmunity of Blackpool owe it to their children and their children's children to take their part in the regulation and improvement of any such manifest defects as the One to which their attention is now drawn. Cremation may not give rise to altogether pleasant thought*. We do not like the idea of burning the bodies of the dead, but I would suggest that we, at all events, should know that they ate not buried alive, and that is a feature which, although absurd on the surface, is nevertheless a terror to thousands of people now living, for instances of persons being • buried alive have been recorded, and are still happening. But I must conclude, having already occupied too much of your valuable space. I trust, however, that other of your readers will give their views on this important, and to my mind, urgent subject, , and beg to remain, yours very truly, PUBLIC HEALTH.

On Tuesday evening the third annual concert by the pupils of NIL Join. Kok-Alblaa, Whetstone-lane, was given in the Claughton Music Hall. There was a crowded and fashionable audience. Mr. Paul Lange, who presided, opened the proceedings by warmly eulogising Mr. Kok-Alblas as a teacher and conductor, instancing the careful training of which his own children had received. He caused some amusement by calling attention to the fact that a young lady was playing the double bass that evening, and said that in a short time, ladies would be found who could perform on wind instruments as successfully as they had shown they could upon the violin. The composition of theorchestra was as follows— Firat violins: Misses E. Bloor, Rose Thompson Louie Smith, Pryce Jones, A. Broeklebank, M Latham, Pollie Pritchard, Jennie Price, May }fining, F. Lange, Blanche Simpson ; second violins: Misses B. Kok-Alblas, Stella Brolly Ethel Jahnke, May Smith, Eva Roe, Rebe Wild, Nellie Gast, Adelina Sinclair, Buckley, McEvoy, Mr. Alderwood,'Master L. Montgomery, Mimes Annie Knowles, and Amy Knowles; ' violas: Miss Harbridge, Mr. Willie Shaw; violoncellos: the Misses L. Harbridge, Mabel Roe Ruby Lange, Evie Smyth, Mathews, Masters Arthur Lee and James Shaw ; contra basses: Memos, Jones and Davies; piano: Miss Lucy Harbridge ; oboes: Mr. Bridger ; flutes: Messrs Lawler and Mercer; clarionettes Messrs. W. H. Lowkee and Bowker ; bassoon: Mr. J. J. Alexander; born: Mr. Rabin; corsets: Messrs. Jones and Dobbins; euphonium: Mr. Wright; trombones: Messrs. Field and Kelly; tympani: Mr. J. B. Jackson. The orchestra were particularly successful in their performance of the march from ""The Prophete "" (Itleyerbeer), selections from the Bohemian Girl, and a march from "" Tannhaueer "" (Wagner). Miss Ruby Lange played a solo on the 'cello, "" Chanson d' Amour "" (St. George), displaying thereby considerable taste and executive skill. The feature of the evening, instrumentally, was the first appearance of the Ladies' ""Octet,"" who gal/elm Idylle by Labitsky, and a Meditation by Faumnier. The first part was rather out of tune, but the second one went in very good form, and, considering the performers were very young ladies, was played with remarkable strength. Violin solos were played by Miss Rose Thompson, Miss Betty Kok-Alblas, and Miss E. 'Moor, and in' each ease, though the audience were very appreciative, encores were disallowed, owing to the length of the programme. The concert was charmingly diversified by the vocal efforts of Miss L. Smith and Mr. James Murphy, and altogether was decidedly the most successful which the pupils of Mr. J. KokAlblas have so far given. "

It deals with its operations tram Mardi, 1917, to April, 1918, and states that, founded in 1892, the records show a von. tinnous increase in membership and tn rfluence. It proceeds: ""It is very gratifviug to report that in this the silver jabil.a year the Council was stronger than ever, and probably in the near future will •oap thee fruit of the strenuous labours of lb( past quarter of a century.

Wages had been ad. vanced periodically, while the Government had expresse- d a strong desire to eliminate overtime wherever posaible. This was a sane policy, but the good effects had been largely nullified by a corresponding rise in the priee of commodities. Advances of wages accompanied by increases in the ec.st of living had been well described -is mi. yelling in a vicious circle, as the advautcs were met, not by productivity, but by an inflated paper currency, whii was bound to operate sooner or later against the financial stability of the country. the workers wore realising that advance* of wages were not in themselves suffilieat to solve the problem of decent, healthy liv.

Reference is then made to the amsl,ra. motion of kindred trades, gratification is expreesed at the molts achieved during the year in regard to the housing question, and it is recorded that ""as it will be some time after the conclusion of the war before housing needs can be met, in conjunction with other Councils we are urging 1L.,Government to extend the Rents Act to two years instead of six months after the war ends. the time at present stipulated in the Act.""

TUE fortnightly meeting of the above Society was held at the Music Hall, Claughton-road, on Monday last. Mr. A. Whytt, the president, in the Main  The paper announced for the evening was "" The life history of a rain drop ; "" to be read by Air. Reid, butlhat gentleman was detained at York, by severe indisposition, and so prevented from being present. The President read an interesting cutting from a newspaper, descriptive of the formation of ice in various ways, particularly its natural formation in summer in certain caves, and the cultivation of ice by night in the neighbourhood of Calcutta. The Rev. 111. Kaufmann then read a paper on John Ruskin, with particular reference to the Slade Lectures and ""Sesame and Lilies,"" the works at present under study by the Birkenhead Ruskin Society. The paper he had already read before the Ruskin Society, and an account of it appeared in the Birkenhewl News of the 12th inst., to which we refer our readers.  The Rev. Mr. Kingsmill thought that in forming such societies as the Ruskin Society there was an Undue tendency to hero worship. He agreed that there was no necessary conflict between the useful and the beautiful, and the tendency of the times was to recognise that fact. Many of Ruskiu's principles, though sufficiently expressed, were as old as the human intellect itself. The work of the society would, however, be good in respect of leading people to etudy the original works of the author, instead-of being content, as was too often the case, to acquire their instruction at second hand in a more or less diluted condition. The idea of doing something toward improving the dwellings of the working classes was a very good one. There were two prevailing theories relative to the working classes. One that they were very poor, dependent, and wretched, the other that they were the lords and masters of the country, and that property and privilege existed only on their sufferance. The truth he believed to lie between these two extremes. The working classes were very independent and objected to being dictated to either in matters of art or anything else. . One of the most admirable things in Mr. Ruskin's teachings was his maintenance of the dignity of labour. As long as the so-called upper classes treated labour as contemptible, so long would the working classes imitate them and spend in idleness such time as they could spare for their labour. They must take away the false idea that the only way to rise was to rise out of one's lot instead of rising in it. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Rees said he had not read many of Mr. Ruskin's works, but as far as he was able to judge from what he had read Mr. Raskin did not seem to lay so much stress on the practical as on the good and pure. To his (the speaker's) mind, if a man was practical he WS also to that extent good and pure. He considered the philosophy of bread and cheese to be the most important philosophy in society at the present day. Agriculture and cookery were the most important elements of society. After due attention to these they might come to appreciate works of art, but without them Mr. Ruskin's theories mast altogether fail in practice. Mr. Keyworth said he had already heard the paper read at the Raskin Society, and so pleased was he with it that he should be delighted to hear it even a third time. The Rev. W. Biuns said he did not think there was any likelihood of readers of Ruskin becoming hero worshippers, at any rate of the writer himself. Although an almost infinitely original genius, he was a growing, developing, backward and forward moving genius all the years of his literary life. The ""Lectures on Art"" and "" Sesame and Lilies"" could not be taken as altogether representing him. He must be looked upon as a creature of evolution. Comparing hie earlierutterances with his later ones, he WAS brought to the conclusion that Mr. Ruskin corrected and modified himself. The real principles of Raskin were laid down in the series of letters called the  ""Fore,"" and with these he doubted whether a single member of the Raskin Society would agree. Those who really carried out Ruskin's views were the volunteers oilwhat was termed the "" Guild of St. George,"" who were very beautiful-souled people, bat, perhaps, not very strong-minded people. There were great practical differences between Mr. Ruskin and modern society. Most of the things, such as railways, steamships, factories, dtc., of which the country was most proud, received very severe judgment in Mr. Ruskin's later utterances. Mr. Ruskila would like to have all agriculture carried on by the spade, and to have all ladies spinning and making their own dresses. ' He was, therefore, not a good practical adviser, but he was a grand idealist. Mr. Reid thanked the President and the Society for expressing their sympathy with his brother, who was unable to attend to read his promised paper. He expressed his opinion that there was, up to the present, a deficienoy of the art faculty amongst workingmen. Workingmen prided themselves upon the possession of energy and common sense, and the calm receptive attitude of to many modern lovers of art was hardly likely to have for them any great attractions. Canon Smith repudiated the idea of accepting art, as the highest ideal to be aimed at. There must be something above and dominating art. be it religion or philosophy. Art in itself need not necessarily be good, and could only exercise a beneficent influence when under the influence and domination of truth, whether philosophic or religions.  • Mr. Bryson agreed with the views of Canon smith as to art requiring the guidance of something higher than itself. There was no great novelty in Mr. Ruskin's teaching, but in what high teaching was there much novelty? The great advantage to be drawn from Anskin's works was that they would lead them to the study of the ideal.  The Chairman questioned whether art in itself was necessarily any help to morality. His own experience was that the mind was elevated rather by the study of nature than art. (Hear. hear.) A working man, though not caring for art, frequently had a very keen appreciation of nature, and was, therefore, a true man.  The Rev. Mr. Kaufmann briefly replied to criticisms on his paper, and the meeting separated. "

They had laid the foundations of a sound system of the taxation of land values, and he did not think that Mr. Gladstone in his most powerful period did anything which would compare with the carrying through of the land clauses in the Budget. He thought the public were the people to receive the reward of public enterprise. They had called upon the liquor traffic to pay a larger contribution. It was the first occasion that land had been called upon to pay a reasonable amount. Another important departure was that in this Budget would be secured for the first time the valuation of land.

Bellbouse, and further with committing damage upon a watch chain and hat, the property of Sergeant Darrock. Sergeant Darrock said about 9.30 on Saturday night be was in plain clothes in Seacombe village when be saw the two prisoners in company with three women. They were drunk, and went into the Abbotsford Hotel. He also went in, and told the barman not to supply them with drink. After coming out of the hotel they remained in the street for about half us-hour, and made use of very bad language. He advised them to go away, but they refused and commenced to be very abusive. Hedges tried to borrow a knife from a man named Armstrong. and threatened to out him (the sergeant) open. The two men then deliberately sprang upon him. He threw Hedges down and fell on the top of the other. Ultimately P.C. Bellhouse came to his assistance. On the way to the station the tallest of the prisoners(Devaney)snatched witness's watch chain from one of his pockets, and the other snatched it from him and hit him (the sergeant) on the bead with it. He was struck and kicked all over by both the prisoners, and they had to get assistance from the public to get the two men to the station. Dr. Davidson, who was a witness of the occurrence, gave corroborative evidence, and said that prisoner Hedges deliberately kicked P.C. 881111000 in the abdomen. He never saw a more brutal or more unprovoked attack on the police. Sergeant Detre& used great forbearance in peremadiog the men to go home. P.C.

There was a crowd of three or four hundred people around. When at the corner of Brighton-street the prisoner Hedges kicked him on the abdomen, and he had had to be off day Arthur Edward Black and George Woods also gave further evidence, the latter stating that he nearly got his finger broken in the melee. Hedges, whose black and bloodshot eye gave evidence of the severe nature of the encounter, declared that be did not remember one thing aftereix o'clock on Saturday night, as he was blind drunk. The Bench decided to send the two men each to gaol for one month with hard labour for being drunk and disorderly, and further for three months each for assaulting and beating the police. For wilfully damaging the silver watch chain they would he fined 158. and the damage. 4s. 31. each, or go to gaol for a further term of seven days with bard labour.

SAD FATALSTY AT THE 'Dotxs.—An inquest was held before Mr. Churton on Weduesday afternoon at the Queen's Hotel, Conway.street, on the body of John Bradshaw, a flatman, who met with an awfully sodden death whilst working that morning. It appeared from the evidence adduced that deceased wee employed on a fiat at ten minutes past six that (Wednesday) morning in the Hest Float, when John Bradd, who was in the °shin of the flat, came on board and saw the deceased struggling in the water. Aocording to the aituells's evidence he bad only been in the water a few seconds, but another witness who saw deceased fall overboard swore that it was six or seven minutes. There was a braise on the left side of the temple, and the coroner said it was quite evident the man had not been drowned but that in falling had come in contact with something on tha adjoining flat. He had died when taken ashore before being taken to the hospital on the ambnlance, and seemed to have been unconscious. A verdict of "" Accidentally killed by falling from the flat"" was  returned.

But Elsie, pretty wilful Elsie, is too angry to listen to her lover's reasonings. She is Jack Redfern's promise! wife, and she looks for blind devotion from him ; she wants to be like the heroines of certain romances she has read, and be set up on a pinnacle, with Jack always at her feet. Jack is mate on I oard the Bonnie Jane, as tine a merchant vessel as any to be seen in 'London flocks. he is a tall, manly young fellow, with curly brown locks, and a pair of grey oyes, so pure end true that i they look down all that s paltry and evil in man or %omen. With all his heart and soul this young sailor loves Elsie May. Have they not grown up together from children ? and, on his very first voyage, did he not bring her home a marvellous big pink-hued shell, that she might put it to her little ear, and, listening to the echo of the sounding sea, think tenderly of him, who, roving where he might, ever bore the thought of her within his heart ? Even thus he loved her ; but he would not let his love blind him to Elsie's faults and failings, or hold , back words of faithful counsel when he saw that they were called for. And now he and Elsie are having their ""first quarrel 1"" Look how her band trembles as she makes believe to straighten the little quillings round that pretence of an apron, with its utterly impracticable pockets, tat suits her dainty figure so well She is at once angered and resolved. Jack is not behaving in the least like the lovers in those delightful romances; she will eat be found fault with, least of all in the choice of her friends. Time enough for him to take upon himself the (ace of censor when they are quite old married  people. ""You have no business to interfere with me in this way; I shall choose my friends for myself,"" she says, indignantly, giving her head suub, a toss that a stray lock falls on her shoulder, and lies there in all its rippling beauty against the blue  dress she wears. I can hardly have no bu•siness ' with anything that concerns you, dear,"" begins Jack. But the girl will not listen. ""1 will not be interfered with,"" she reiterates ""Belle is inv friend, not yours."" And when we are man and wife are we to have separate friend, ties? Will you make friends if people I don't like and don't approve of then 1"" says Jeer. gravely. ""I don't know; I don't know that then will over come."" She doesn't mean it; in her heart of hearts she loves this fine young manly lover of hers most utterly and entirely ; she '6rould fly out et anyone who dared to say a word against him in her presence. She and Jack's mother are wont to corn. pare notes as to his many delightful qualities of mind and person; they strive to outdo each other in eulogising the mato of the Bonnie Jane, and nerve each other on to offer up the choicest incense at the shrine of their idol. lint Elsie has forgotten all this just now. ""Belie Davis loves all things that a true woman should hate ; she is never happy unless she is making herself noticed in one way or other, and she delights in gossip—in evil speaking----"" Here Jack palls up sharp. He finds himself about to finish a strongly-wordel quotation, and wisdom counsels silence. ""You have always disliked her,"" breaks out Elsie, hotly. "" Yes, always,"" be answers, honestly, speaking very quietly, but losing some of the healthy colour from his cheek, nevertheless. Obstinacy, wounded vanity, pride, and something that she, poor gay child, calls self -respeet, enter into and possess Elsie s souL "" I—will—not —give —Belle—up,"" she says, letting e ich word drop slowly from lips that are whits with passion. e...""

But Elsie will not speak. One little foot taps ism atiently upon the carpet; her lips are set hard and fast together, all the harder, perhaps, because it is somewhat difficult to prevent them quivering, as Jack speaks in that strange and solemn way. "" Oh, my darling !"" cries the man at last, maddened by her silence; ""don't deny me one gentle and forgiving word; I might have to go to-night, I Isle, I cannot unsay what I have said about— Belle—but, dear, forgive me if I have wounded you. Still Elsie 'is silent; and he cannot see her face, for she keeps it turned away from him. Suddeuly there is a sound of footsteps on the stairs. It is Mr. May, Elsie's father. comieg up from the shop below, for the shutters are put up, and the last assistant has taken his departure. "" Mae !"" says Jack, imploringly; ""haven't you a word for me But it is too late now; Mr. May is in the room, and his wife has hurried from the upper regions to inquire if he is ready for supper. ""Won't you stay, my lad ?"" he says, heartily, as Jack bids a hasty good-night all round. But Ja.l mutters some excuse, and in another moment Isle sees him pass along the street below in the duection of hie own home. The girl chatters away all supper-time, and hums a tune as she go:s up to her Ittle room an hour later. Then she lies down, all dressed as she is, and falls into a passion of weeping. The night is half past by the time she rises, cold an l miserable, and dazed with a dull, aching pain i • her hi ad. she takes off her clothes in the darkness, and creeps into bed. But when she is at last asleep, a soft smile rests upon her lips; for she has made a resolve that holds healing balm even in thought. She will go to Mrs. Redfern'e early—ever so early —in the morning; she will not wait for Jack to coins to her. She will go to him' and ask him to forgive her; for, in her heart, Elsie knows that what Jack said is true, and that Belle is no good fri nil for anyone. And so. as soon as the household work is seen to in the morning, she sets off to Mrs. Redfern's. Dark shadows beneath her pretty eyes tell of a night of tear,: and a tremble hovers about the little south, that Jack, in his own mind, has often likened to a half .blown rose. The girl soon reaches Randolf-street, where the widow, Mrs. Redfern, owns a small, yet cOmfortab:e house,lives in the lower rooms with her daugh t f Lisle, and lets the upper ones to great advantage. Elsie knocks, and Lizzie comes in answer to her Nimmons. The child's Pyre are red and heavy; and something makes Elairie heart give a sickening thud. and holds her silent, as the two pass on into the parlour, where Jack's mother sits plying her sewingmachine. She raises her eyea from her work, aud the girl meets a look of sorrowful reproach; her eyes are so like Jack's, too, that it is alit he worse to inset them. ""Is Jack ml"" says Elsie, faintly, feeling as if each word would choke her. ""I want to see him very much —"" "" Jask is gone,"" says Mrs. Redfern. ""He found his orders waiting for him whsn he came home last night. The Bonnie Jane sailed with the early tide this morning."" _  It is four months now since the Bonnie Jane sailed out with the early tide. Mrs. Redfern comes of ""Scotch folk,"" and, consequently, there is an element of ctddrness in h r nature thnt leads her to condemn uncompromisingly what she disapproves of; and forbids, rather than invites, confidence, or the expression of regret. The widow loves her son with a passion of tendernew, that is all the stronger for being little given to outward demonstration, and resents a wrong done to him with like intensity and silence. Her boy's troubled face, as he road tbe few lines that summoned him to join his ship—the few bitter words that dropped from his lips in the hurry and excitement of the moment —could not be forgotten. And so it came about that now a-days Elie rarely took her way to the little home in Handal street. * One - below, that he to find I Stay. "

A meeting in support of the Licensing Bill was held on Saturday evening at Market-place South. Mr. W. Sherrington presided, and moved a resolution approving the main provisions of the Bill, and pledging the meeting to support it in every possible way. He was very pleased to be there, he said, to let them know that he had great sympathy with the Licensing Bill. Every working man and woman should be interested in it, because if anyone would profit by the Bill, it was the housewife with children to be shielded from the dangers of the drink traffic.  Mr. W. J. Lies sesonded the resolution. He said he was a lover of truth and hated exaggeration, and for that reason he was prepared to meet some of the etatemente against the Licensing Bill. He wished the licensed victuallers had more of the victualler and less license about them (hear, hear and applause). For some reason, the Conservative Government in 1904 thought fit to substitute for a yearly license a perpetual license, and bemuse they did that he ventured to say they robbed the nation of what belonged to it. It was an admitted fact that there were 90,000 licenses in excess of the requirements of the people, and the Government had decided that these licenses should be extinguished as soon as they fairly could. Wherever magistrates did not reduce the licenses rapidly enough, a central authority would make them do their duty, and that was a sane provision of a very sensible Bill. A time limit of 14 years was fixed to existing licensee, and at the end of that time the nation would get back what ought never to have been taken from it. The licensed victuallers told them that 2,000,000 people would be thrown out of work, but there were not 2,000,000 employed in the Trade, and there were only a third of the licenses going to be stopped in the course of 14 years. The liquor traffic was one of the greatest sources of weakness to the nation, and anything that could be done ought to be done to lemon this evil. At the present time the supervision of the liquor traffic was in the hands of magistrates, but the possession of a comfortable income too often prevented them from seeing what the working man had to face, and the difficulties of his' life. They were not the best judges of the needs of a neighbourhood and therefore the Government Licensing Bill provided that at the end of a certain time the people themselves should determine the number of public-houses which should exist in a given place, and what should be the hears of opening and closing. When they heard that cry about robbery and the ruin of widows and orphans, he asked them to consider the true position. Let them think of the widows and orphans who were being made and robbed daily by the excessive drinking which. went on in their midst, and support the Government's effort to improve the conditions of their fellow creatures. The only widows and orphans who would suffer were those who held brewery shares, and they wire not many. Besides, *hes, hau airecey been well robbed by the hr's-era, whose companies had been grossly over-c.spitalleid. They wanted argument, net abuse; .facts, not prejudice; reason, and not passion (lip planes). Mr. H. Davis Cox supported the resolution, and said the need of it drastic reform in the licensing business was not only the qonviction of lifelong tempereues workers, but it was also the delitvr.itely recorded opinion of almost every responsible statesman of both political 'parties or centuries past. It was she recerdsf opinion of the Trade itself, and h. woeld my nothing stronger than what the brewers told them when they said a gigantic evil remained to be remedied. The nation had often proved it had a heart to be touched and a brain to be convinced, and he was aertain that if only the people understood this Bill they would strike a blow for a great reform. We spent .2160,000,000 in drink every year, together with £70,000,000 in the repression of crime, and .295,030,000 for the administration of our poor law. That did not take into account the huge sum given in charity to maintain hospitals, asylums, etc. The Trade contributed only £9,000,000 in license duties. Would anybody say that was anything like sufficient? Looking at the matter from the moral standpoint, the existence of this traffic was largely responsible for the 160,000 people who were convicted every year. Prison governors and asylum commissioners all told the same tale of the vital connection between strong drink and crime andlunaey. Every two years a population equal to that of Birkenhead was wiped out through excessive drinking. Of 184 men who applied for outdoor relief for the first time, something like 170 admitted they were confirmed drunkards, twelve said they were moderate drinkers, and one claimed be was a teetotaller, but it was afterwards found he was given to telling untruths. Mr. BalfOur's Act had already done the best that could be expected from it. For two years since it was passed the reduction of licensee had been at the rate of 1 per cent., and that was merely tinkering with the problem. When a man's neighbour got into trouble through the excessive temptations to drink, he should feel that he had a share of the, responsibility as one of the community which issued the licensee, and the Government proposed in its Bill to bring that responsibility home to every man and woman in the country. He would rather think about the men and women and children who were being ruined in Birkenhead, than bother his head about one particular brewer, and if it could be demonstrated to him that one widow who held shares in a brewery concern was going to be ruined and at the same time he could see 500 other women and their children who would be benefited, he would rather let the one widow be ruined. It was always a safe doctrine to consider the greatest good of the greatest number. Mr. Harold Smith; according to ""The Birkenhead News,"" had been talking to some Tory workingmen and had told them this Bill meant robbery and confiscation. They had seen that evening that if there was any robbery it was on the other side. Mr. Smith said this Bill was a Socialist is Bill, and workingmen Conservatives dreaded Socialism. But Mr. Emith also advised us to follow our colonies on another Alibied. Then why not follow them on this, for they had already. adopted similar principles to those the Government was now proposing? Should we lag behind our kinsmen &crone the toea on thie subject of all others? He urged them all to support the Licensing Bill becaum he believed it would bring about a better day for our trade, our homes, the women and children, and I for our country generally (applause). The resolution was unanimously carried. "

Si,—Yoar kindness to correspondents prompts me to write a word re your leading article in Saturday's issue on this subject, with much of which I agree. I feel that we (you and I) ass more clearly on this matter than our fathers did, whilst the country at large does not seem to have advanced. 4. proof of this is the fact published in your Wednesday ii issue, that ire hive to support a colony of 400 pauper lunatics and never se much as inquire how they came to be such. We must be bad indecd when illustrious eedonials and Americans can remark ""thit they have seen more drunken men and women in six weeks in this country than they ever see in their own country in all their lives. The sight of barmaids in the public-house, the sight of women with little babies giving the babies drink even in the beautiful cities of Scotland, was worse than they could per sibly Bei when prohibition law was least regarded and least enforced."" You ask for a more practical method than total prohibition, but we know of none. Why don't you, Mr. Editor, formulate one, You say:— ""Such a modification is to be found on the one hand in a judicious regulation of the sale of 'drink, and on the other hand in the judicious treatment of drunkards. We call that regulation judicious which encourages the publican to keep his house orderly from motives of self-respect instead of merely dodging the police. Something in this way could be effected by so modifying the law that licenses would attach to the individual rather than to the house. The publican should be more than an acting manager or a tenant at will. Again, everything that is possible should be done to make publichouses into true places of refreshment instead of mere drinking shops."" All this has been tried ever since the evils existed, with what result anyone can see. It is perfectly evident that, whatever be the condition under which the trade is, carried on, the results are ever the same—crime, poverty. and insanity. It makes no difference to these results whether the retailer be called ""publican"" or ""licensed victualler."" You call attention to the value of example, and the importance of personal influence, and call ""this the true method of reform,"" as though there could be no other. ite it is true 'there are many ways of killing a cat besides hanging,"" so there are many ways of rescuing society from drink evils, and if those who deprecate the methods would only formulate something better, all might be well—but they don't. You give the old paton-the-back for the publican in saying ""No respectable wine merchant, brewer, or publican approves of drunkenness or desires to make his profits out of it. He has a commodity to w.ll for which there is a demand; a commodity which—though like others, is is capable of abuse—in his opinion has its legitimate nee. He no more desires to make his trade of drunkenness than the game-dealer or butcher desires to make his trade of gluttony. If only people would avoid excess he would be saved a vast deal of trouble and anxiety. No good can come from abusing him."" Now, isn't this a bit of palaver? Do not publicans' servants (men and women) work more hours and under more baneful and unhealthy conditions than any other trade?—no factory inspector interfering. Is not it the only trade that universally opens on a Sunday when the law allows, and would, only for this law, in some cases never be closed? I should think from this you imagine the public-house existed to promote the public welfare regardless of its own. It would not be an extreme thing to say that great evils have been the result of the establishment of every public-house. On the other hand, where has been the evil of teetotalism or prohibition? Statistics from insurance societies, which have both teetotal and moderate drinkers insured (and immoderate drinkers are not insured at all, and publicans only at increased rates) prove beyond reasonable doubt that the health and longevity of teetotalers exceeds that of moderate drinkers. Then in Canada, New Zealand, and various of the States, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of prohibition. In Elisabeth Black you point to the hopelessness of the present system, but if you could save her from getting as she is. would it not be better than sending her to a home, which seems to be your only mode of reform? And even this you would hand over to more earnest men to get put into effect. To sum the matter up, no adequate scheme of reform seems feasible except through the ballot-box, and the man who can vote for Tory candidates, either in municipal or Nirliamentary contests—who are invariably chary of promising any real reform in this matter, and are, as a party allied with the dgink interest—is false to everything that is likely to effect a radical cure. The party is run and supported in the interest of the trade, and no Christian, or even atheist, can honestly support it. At election time* the Tories have the knack of painting black as if it was white, and, unfortunately, make workingmen and others (foolish ones, I admit) believe they (the Tories) will help on temperance reform, and have even capoled one or two earnest temperance men, and the Bishop of Chester, into furthering their plans. When they get into power they do not fulfil one single promise). Iliej even I'sfuse to facilitate the .Children's Bill and the Sunday Closing for Monmouthshire Yours, &ow A PROUIBMONIST. "

AFTER DINNER.  Before breakfast next morning, Sir John took Captain Guest into his confidence as to his proposed plan of visiting the East and endeavouring to see his boys. Gerald strongly advised him to make no delay about it, and volunteered starting that day to be on the look out for any information that might come to the authorities at the Horse Guards.  But this the baronet objected to; he had no notion of letting Gerald leave him at present, and having settled to start with him for London the day after the battue, which had been appointed for the day following, he dismissed the subject for the present. But though Sir John went out with thst shooting party that day, he did not do much more than walk to the coppice, and after firing some half dozen shots, and missing each time, turned his gun over to a keeper, and came home, shutting himself up in the library, very glad to have time to look carefully through the contents of his mother's bequest; and Lady Wimbourne was busy in her own room, having no idea that her husband had returned, did not disturb him. The shooting party returned about dark, and with them the rector, who was too fond of a day in pheasant covers to miss the meetings at Thornhill; as .he passed the library the door was thrown open, and Sir John stood upon the threshold for an instant, then turning, he shut and locked the door, putting the key in his pocket. ""Blue Beard closet, John,"" laughed the rector, and the baronet startled; he had not seen anyone, and his flushed face wore a blank suspicions expression though he attempted to look natural and unconcerned. ""You ran away from us very soon,"" the parson went on ""Richards said you didn't seem in order; you  don't look the thing at all, John; I wish you' would let an old friend like me help you a bit, or let me prescribe, all we country parsons are, or ought to be, half doctors; let me feel your pulse."" ""Pooh, pooh, Ned; do you want to make an old woman of me? Blistering and bolusjug don't suit my book; a glass of brandy's more about the mark. Truth is, my poor mother's papers required looking over, and I'm a bad hand at business, and have a nasty headache in the bargain; we'll shoot it off to-morrow. How does the weather look ?"" "" Splendid ! But don't take any more brandy, John, you've not had your walking to-day, and ought to snit your drink to the amount of counter excitement—wear and tear. Take a glass of sherry and bitters; stomach out of order; system deranged with that abominable Scotch whiskey. I wish you'd try my old uncle's hunting flask, I've some upstairs."" ""Tincture of Rhubarb is not exactly my tipple, old fellow, we'll see about the sherry presently. I see you are in a hurry to get off the leggings, and there's my lady's' maid coming to7remind me of the time.' During dinner, Sir John was visibly nervous and excitable; and Lady Wimborne, who bad heard from him how he had been occupied all the afternoon, watched him with fear and trembling; and never in her life had she felt more relieved than when the time for quitting the dinner-table came. But there was little chance of a reqpite ; a footman brought in a note, and while she was reading it over for something like the tenth time, her troubled face and shaking hands betraying how great the interest it held, the rector's daughters came in, and unable to bear their usual flow of talk, she took refuge in the small drawing-room. There the murmur of voices in the dining room was audible; and, as she stood by the fire,she distinctly heard her husband's rising over all, strained and unnaturally loud it seemed. She listened, and a cold shudder crept over her. The afternoon's work with the papers had been to much for him; the danger she had been warding off had stolen upon her. Presently, the butler went into the room, leaving the door open far a time. The horrible ring of that voice was too plain ; she put her hands to her ears, and pausing now and then by the doorway in hopes of hearing symptoms of the gentlemen moving. How slowly the time went ! more than once she took out her watch, and compared it with the timepiece, but both told the same unwelcome story--time was right, it was only the agony of fear and suspense that so far outran its pace. Again and again she framed mesPages and determined to send for her husband: then she would dread calling attention to his state, and put it off in the vain hope of relief coming naturally, and without any unnecessary proceeding on her part. Presently there was a hasty footstep in the ball, and Gerald Guest opened the door. Lady Wimbome turned in her passionate walk, and stood facing him, nerving herself as best she could--the suspense was to be over now; but how, she dared not ask; and there was that in her face which, for a few minutes, tied Gerald's tongue. He had thought of what be would say as he came in, but planned speeches are seldom uttered when the heart is in the matter, and all Gerald said was, ""I'll bring the men into the drawing-room, if you will get Sir John up to bed—don't be frightened, it's only the excitement of yesterday."" Then, as Lady Wimb,rne shuddered, and her breath came with a gasp, he tried to make excuses, dreading he had said too much, but she shook her head, and beckoned him to go away, and following him closely, went into the breakfast-room, from which a door opened into the dining-room, where she waited until Captain Guest had performed his mission. Sir John was sitting at the table, with his head leaning forward upon his breast, but the sullen, vacant stare, with which he had watched the men leave the room vanished directly his wife came to his side, and an uneasy shame-faced lock took its place, as putting his arm round her her, he said, ""Well, old woman, what brings you here?"" ""I saw you were ill during dinner, dear, and was waiting until they were away to come; I'm so glad you didn't leave the room—l wont you to come and tell me about the packing, and rest quietly."" ""Quietly !"" he repeated, with a whole volume of woe and weariness thrilling in his low voice—"" quietly, is it? There's no rest for the wicked, Maggie. What blunders people do make !—there's Ned, the parson, been drinking like a fish all night, and not a shake in him, and—but Maggie, if I don't go back to them, they'll think I'm drunk, and that would never do. It's all those papers."" ""Never mind what they think, dear—they couldn't be such fools; you had a headache, Mr. Topley told me so."" ""Parson Ned told you? Ah, so he did, and wanted me to drink brandy —no, sherry it was ; he wanted the brandy himself. Who said I had a headache? Heartache is nearer the mark; but you're right, I have a headache, and a splitting one, too; it's going like a sledge-hammer here, in my temples; can you feel the pulse? What's that about bed? —do you think I could sleep with my head hammer, hammer, hammer, ring, ring, ring, just like an anvil ?"" He looked up in her face, and then laid his burning forehead upon her shoulder, whispering. ""How cold you are, darling; shivering, too, and here I am, burning like a fire! I cannot go into the drawing-room, so you must by-and-bye; but don't leave me now, Pet. What a strength the little hand has !"" and he looking up fondly as she helped him to rise, and, keeping it on his arm, walked to the door, getting upstairs with a slow, step. ""Don't leave me, Maggie,"" as she went back to close the bedroom-door. ""1 m not right at all, darling, it's all those papers and letters that have done the mischief- my mother should have told me."" ""What dear?""  But lie only shook his head. ""Not now; we'll talk it over to-morrow; but remember, I had no suspicion of it—not one. I swear that he will never blame me, he's too good a fellow for that; but it's a queer business, a very queer business!"" Then, after a pause, ""What did Gerald say about being born in Ireland, Maggie ?"" ""I do not remember; I think he said Wicklow was his country. You told him about going to the East ?"" she went on, eager to get her husband to think of some other than the subject which seemed such a sore one. ""He was speaking of it just before dinner; he says we shall have to take out a number of comforts for the boys."" ""Did he? He's a good fellow, Gerald; I wish Silvia had taken him instead of that boy—Boyle. I think I'll turn in, darling, and you can run down and do the civil to those chaps. I'm better now, thank God ! They were making such a deuce of a row, and you are such a doctor, with your soft voice and cool hands.""  Lady Wimborne saw he was better, and did his bidding; when she came up again her husband had fallen into a quiet sleep. She sat down by the window, and shading the light from the bed began to read; but it is no easy task to make ourselves read, and harder still to force our understanding to comprehend the Hues of words along which the obedient eye may move. Lady Wimborne could not read; she turned to the fire, and after a time tears came, and with them a sense of rest and comfort. Midnight tolled out before she thought of undressing, and then just as she rose to do so, her husband awoke and sitting up looked at her with a gentle smile. ""Reading the Bible, Pet ?"" he said; ""if you're not tired read me a hit; be been dreaming about it, and about the lads, God bloss them! I'll see them before I'm many days older.""

We could DOW rejoice that these brave old men could realise their country's good wishes in their life time. In rambling through the grounds we vitae to a sign board ""Capitol Vista,"" and there looking through a vista of beautiful trees, the tine 'dome of the Capital appeared in the far distance. Leaving the grounds on the oppoaite side from the one we had entered, we found, close to the gates, another soldiers' cemetery similar to Arlington, the same ranging of soldiers graves iu long rows, similar handsome monuments to Generals and officers ; also a beautiful rostrum of Italian marble used on Decoration days, usually kept covered at other tithes to protect it from the weather. Tuesday, October 23rd, left Washington with great regret in order to pay a visit to Chicago. Another journey of a day and a night in a Pullman car. On entering our drawing room car we felt that it was 80 delightfully comfortable that we could go right across the continent te San Francisco and enjoy the journey, but the rush of a quick train is trying even under the inoht comfortable circumstances, and we found our journey quite long enough. We soon came to the banks of the Susquehama river, which we followed till beyand Harrisburg, when we loot the fair wide river, and seemed to follow one of its tributaries until it was only a mountain stream up in the Alleghenies, which stream we crossed again and again as our train got higher and higher. We enjoyed the lovely mountain scenery, and sighed for the long summer evenings, for by the time our train reached Altoona (where we took a second engine, the ascent was now being steeper) it was quite dark ' • it was therefore imI possible for us to see the famous ""Horse Shoe I Curve"" which our train followed round the sides of the high mountains near the point, and to our great regret we passed over the mountains and down the other side in the night. When we awoke in the morning the hills had vanished, and we looked out over what had been the Prairie; now roads are gradually being made, crossing the country in different directions. Now and then we came upon solitary farm houses and clearings, then passed busy towns, and groups of houses, the possible beginnings of towns then againsettler'a houses, and long stretches of flat country as before.  About 9 a.m. we arrived at Chicago, or u Will Carleton has styled it, since the groat fire, ""Grand and unconquered Chicago, Still Queen of the Nortjk and she West.""  Our train ran fur some miles through a rather unfinished looking part of the city, South Chicago, with mostly wooden houses, here and there a house more substantial-looking than the rest, then spaces where houses have been burnt down the burnt stakes still in the ground, as though people had been too busy to tidy up. We passed an Hotel bearing the sign, Professor J. R--, Proprietor, and wondered what sort of a professor he must be to keep a second-rate hotel; adjoining the hotel was a circular huilding, with high wooden walls, forming a kind of amphitheatre and the truth dawned upon us; the owner of this place was evidently a Professor -of the ""noble art of self-defence,' which though it may be a good thing in its way is too often made use of to pander to the brutality in low natures. At last we were in the city of immense buildings, of dirt, smoke, bad roads, of princely avenues lined with the dwellings of millionsirem, and of superhuman energy. We were conveyed in an omnibus to the hotel, the charge being 2s. each person for a distance of about a wile. The omnibuses are all under the management of one company, and this reminded us that we were in the city of immense monopolies. Every visitor to Chicago must be impressed by the tremendous height, of the buildings' 17 stories being quite ordinary, the wonderful Masonic Temple is 20 stories high. This is erected on a foundation of cement and iron, the framework of the superstructure being of steel; the whole building is fireproof throughout. It is very interesting to see one of these large buildings in course of erection, they appear to be simply enormous frameworks of iron resting on a solid foundation, the 'different stories being afterwards filled in and finished. They look so terribly high that one fears a collapse some day. I have, however, rambled on to such a length that I must reserve a few more interesting facts about Chicago for my next, and final letter.  81TCR1:A.17,,, NOVEMBER L ERICA H ceald riat Iteuovitre thNwk‘to "

HOUSE OF COMMONS.  The agricultural depression was the chief topic in the House of Commons on Friday night. Mr Chaplin moved for a Royal Commission to inquire into the causes of the depression, and whether those causes have been created or can be remedied by legislation. The motion was seconded by Mr Brassey, who indicated several points on which inquiry would be useful, excluding the exploded doctrine of Protection. Mr Bright asked what the inquiry was expected to bring about if not Protection. The motion was accepted by the Government, and ultimately agreed to. The Government sustained a defeat in the evening sitting of the House of Commons on Tuesday. Mr Sampson Lloyd moved a resolution declaring it desirable that the affairs of commerce and agriculture should be administered by a distinct department under a principal Secretary of State. Mr Forster, Mr Mundella, and others supported the motion, which was generally opposed by the Chancellor of the Excehquer and other members of the Goverement. The First Lord of the Admiralty moved to omit the latter portion of the motion relating to the appointment of a Secretary of State, and on a division the amendment was defeated by 71 to 66, while the original motion was carried by 76 to 56. _ _  The Sunday Cosing Bill, promoted by Mr Stevenson, the member for South Shields, was debated in the House of COlllOlOOB on Wednesday. Mr Wheelhouse moved the rejection of the measure, which he roundly condemned. Sir M. W. Ridley, on the part of the Government, opposed the bill as one for total Sunday closing, but intimated that the Government desired to efftet some reform in the matter, on the lines of the report of the Committee of the House of Lords. Mr Stevenson was ready to assent to a modification in Committee, a course supported by Mr Bright; but Mr Monk thought the hon. member should bring forward a new bill embodying the suggestions made, and moved the adjournment of the debate, whieh was carried by 165 to 162. In the House of Commons on Thursday night, during Committee on the Army Bill, a somewhat stormy scene arose when one of the Irish members notel that a young gentleman in one or the side galleries was taking notes of the number and duration of speeches. The Speaker avowed that the note-taker was there by his authority, as in consequence of the delay of the Army Bill he desired faller minutes. Those minutes had no reference to the Irish members in particular. At a later period of the sitting, Mr Raikee took the chair vacated by the Speaker. "

At the morning sitting, Mr Gladstone moved that the House resolve itself into Committee on the Bill which grants a sum of 25,000 to Lord Alcester. The rejection of the measure was moved by Sir Wilfrid Lawson ; and the debate, in which Lord Randolph Churchill, Mr Cowen, Sir Stafford Northeote, Mr Gladstone, and several Irish members took part, occupied the whole of the sitting. In the evening Sir J. Eardley Wilmot called attention to the position of militia surgeons as regards their pensions, and Mr Alderman Lawrence to the question of the iiihabitert house duty. "

He paid a visit to the commanding officer, and he, nothing loth, ordered a parade of the men under his command, in order that the young lady might make her choice. After a short inspection, she exclaimed, ""That's the man."" ""Franz Beothy,"" shouted the soldiers. And Franz Belithy was his name, and Hungary his native country. Franz was delighted at his conquest; but when Miss Frauenschatz and he were introduced, they found, to their horror, that he could not speak a word of German, nor she a syllable of Hungarian. The young lady remarked, however, that that did not matter in the least, am their hearts 'would soon learn to understand each other. The Daily Telegraph correspondent, who sends this rather remarkable story, adds that Miss Frauenschatz has promised to study Hungarian, but on one condition, to which her bridegroom has given his consent, that the wedding will be celebrated within a week.

SMITH'S SUCCESSOR., The leader of the Ministerial party being now departed, some definite appointment, says the Anti-Jacobin, must be made to fill his place; and  the choice of the man to come is as much canvassed  as the merits of the man that is gone. It is known that Mr.Goschen did not think himself entitled to the reversion of the leadership; and if he remains of that opinion, stiffly of that opinion, nobody can be surprised. Mr. Goschen's rank as a politician is as high as that of any man on the Treasury bench of the House of Commons; and the 'claim of years of experience demands consideration. But the Conservatives have a strong preference ;which is also perfectly natural) for a man bred in the Conservative camp; and it is true beyond all that we are able to understand that Mr. tioschen is not liked amongst those with whom he works. ""Balfour"" is the name that naturally rises to the Conservative's I lips when his opinion on the matter is tydreci; though perhaps the name does not come up with a rush, as it would have done a year atto. But we shall bear, and in fact, do already hear, of other names. It is not only the leadership of the House of Commons that is vacant. There is an empty . . .  place in the Cabinet; and there has been mUch rumour of late about the desirability of a more intimate connection between the Liberal Unionist  leadtra and the Government.  For ourselves, we  have no doubt whatever that the common_ Cause  would be damaged, seriously damaged, by what is called ""fusion"" of the Unionist parties. Fusion of the parties it would not be; but only the sharing of office by one or two individuals—to the dissatisfaction of many rank-and-file Liberal Unionists, and to the disturbance, even to the disgust, of most rank-and-file Conservatives. The Radicalising . .  of -the —Government has gone far enough already-, and it would be Radicalised yet more to a certainty hy such accessions to the Government as are talked of, because the ""accessions"" would feel bound to make it clear that the Cabinet they had joined had quite given up its Conservatism.  MR. SMITH AS LEADER OF 'rim HOUSE. It is somewhat singular that the universal expressions of regret which have been called forth by the unexpected, and in some sense premature death of Mr. W. H. Smith should have been unac companied .by any suggestion that it was due to the unduly aggravated burdens of his Parliamentary post. Had it occurred a year or a couple of years ago, remarks the Saturday Review, we might have confidently anticipated its attribution to this cause. That thcre has le m no such attempt to explain it in present circumstances is probably due to the tact that matters have gone somewhat more smoothly for the Government during the last S,.ssion than in previous ones, and that the duties of the leadership have been proportionately lightened. Nor are we ourselves prepared to say titively that Mr. Smith's labours on the Treasury Bench did, in fact, hasten his end. That they have been onerous—at times exhausting—is true enough; but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that the success with which he discharged his functions was in a great nu asure due to causes which must have rendered them less trying to him than they would have been to many other men. To a Minister of an anxious or excitable habit they might well have become intolerable. But the late lamented leader of the House was favoured by nature with an unemotional temperament which saved him, even when things were going least satisfactorily, from that ""worry"" which, as has often been said with truth, is more surely fatal than any amount of overwork. His dispositions with regard to the arrangement of public business wsre not always proof against criticism; but in the management of the House ot Commons, as in many other undertakings, the steady and resolute execution of plans is a matter of far more importance than their conception, and Mr. Smith's conduct of business was characterised by that happy mixture of tact and firmness which disarms opponents when their disarmament is possible, and overcomes them when it is not.  MR. SMITH. It would be out of place, the Economist remarks, to attempt an estimate of Mr. Smith's career as a politician and not to mention his success as an administrator. Though he had fewer opportunities than most men of his standing as politicians, he , contrived to make himself a high reputation as thel Parliamentary head of a public department. Mr. Smith's tenure of the office of First Lord et the Admiralty during the Tory administration which ended in 1880 was not long, but he managed in spite of that to prove to all persons competent to form an opinion his fitness for the post. His firmness of mind, his sagacity, and his good judgment made him an excellent chief, and he never failed to impress subordinates with the sense of his large ness of view and his capacity of mind. Had Mr. Smith been suffered to remain at the War Office after 1886, it is more than probable that he would have been able to put our military administration upon a sounder footing than it can be said to possess at the present moment. As it was, however, he was called upon to undertake the duties of First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of Commons before he had been able to get well into the official saddle. Into the question of who should succeed Mr. Smith as Leader of the House it would be out of plice to enter on the present occasion. It may be said, however, with confidence that whoever may be selected will find it difficult to achieve a greater success than did Mr. Smith in th,at most thankless and responsible of offices. THE FUTURE OF PARNELLISM.  Upon the consequences of Mr. Parnell's death it is not too soon to speculate, says the Speaker. There seems no reason to doubt that with his die' appearance from the scene the last obstacle to the complete reunion of the Nationalist party in Ireland has been removed. Reunion, as a mattr of fact, would have been secured sooner or later, even if he had lived. Despite the indomitable pluck with which for months past he has been fighting for his own hand, and the stubbornness with which he refused to admit, even to his closest friends, that defeat was possible, he was steadily losing ground week by week. It is not a slight gain to the cause of Irish freedom that the remaining obstacles to reunion have, in a moment, been cleared away, and that when the General Election comes Mr. Parnell will no longer be a disturbing element in Irish politics. It is to be hoped that on both sides In Ireland there will be a disposition to forget and forgive all that has passed. Not a few of the men who clung to their old leader even when he seemed bent upon undoing his own works were animated' by feelings which it is impossible not to respect.' Regard for a great principle was lost in devotion to a remarkable man. For these men, now that Mr. Parnell is gone, there should be no room for doubt as to their future action. Parnellism without Mr. Parnell is as impossible as Bona• partism without Napoleon; and we may confidently expect that the recognised followers of the Member for Cork in the House of Commons and elsewhere will henceforth be found acting in conjunction with the majority of the Irish representatives. Nor is it a small gain that the dangerous classes in Ireland, the ""men of the hillside,"" to whom Mr. Parnell openly beckoned, and whom he encouraged by speeches which seemed animated by the very spirit of recklessnens, have now lost the one man who had the power of leading them and influencing them. THE DEATH OF MR. PARNELL.  iimatead _.  ---- -7-- England svevives all foes, even when they are of her own blood, and gifted with her own qualities of energy and stubborn will; and she has survived Mr. Parnell. It would be affectation says the Spectator, to lament his death, except upon one ground; but on that ground we do most sincerely larr.ent it. We hate to see the great figures of politics pass away, leaving the relics of their power to be scrambled for among a meaner crew, who make themselves reputations out of plans they hardly even understand. By comparison with these around him, and more especially with his instruments, which is the only fair standard of measurement, Mr. Parnell was a great man, entitled to be ranked by all honest enemies as a statesman of unusual force. Whatever his other deficiencies, he possessed, as regarded Milesian Irishmen, the secret of sovereignty, and from the day he assumed the reins to the day when he fell—that is, for 11 years—never was less than the uncrowned King of Ireland; whoever might rage, his order, when he had made up his mind, was final. It is true that he fell almost in a moment, like an idol shattered by a shell; that two-thirds of the people he had ruled deserted him at once, and that they did this on grounds—for the divorce business was a feeble pretext—which shewed that he had not won their completest loyalty; but then, every word of that is also true of Bismarck, and who questions the ""greatness,"" in the historic sense of the first German Chancellor? The waters were closing over Mr. Parnell before he died; but they had closed before that over the maker of Germany, who thought, like the Irishman, that he could never be abandoned. 'The intellect which conceived that he could make Britain abandon a seventh of her home territory without a battle, and defeat 30,000,000 with three, and which so nearly succeeded in that amszing conception, was a great, though it may have been a very rigidly limited intellect. That the character was equally great, we do not of course assert, for, hut that it still remains on the main point an enigma, we should say it was a poor character selfish in essence, as the story which was the occasion, though not the cause, of his downfall chewed; callous about suffering, as his revival of boycotting, the cruel weapon of the Middle Ages, conclusively proved; and indifferent to truth when a purpose was to be gained, as he himself declared in that inexplicable confession before the Judges on the Times Commission.  Beware of how you get into legal difficulty with a tailor. Remember he is just the man to press a suit. ""My son, define ambition."" ""Well, it's always feeling that you want to do something that you know you can't."" A.: ""What do you think of that for a fish story ? ' Q.: ""You should get it patented."" A.: Why'?""

It has been stated that sometimes lakes have been formed by valleys, in mountains along which rivers ran, becoming blocked up. Hut how was the original valley formed? for it forms the aides of floors of the lake. That question is easily answered by reference to the theory of the wearing out of valleys from the mass of the mountains by atmospheric agencies, frost, rainy water, and to a certain extent, by ice. The earth sculpturing occurred first of all; then, during one of the many great movements of the crust, upheaval took place in the course of a valley, and the water was dammed up. This is a clear case. A landslip may move a mass of earth and rock across a valley stream, and the water will be dammed up, and the impediment is lasting, there will be a lake. Or a glacier may descend across the path of another, and the stream underflowing the last will be dammed up and a glacier lake produced. In examining the structure of the earth near large lakes, proofs are afforded of former changes in it, and these preceded the formation of the original hollow, or else occurred whilst it was going on. Sometimes, as in Lake Superior, one side of the lake is formed of rocks and hills which have been stationary during the repeated sinking of the earth in their neighbourhood. and as in some of the Swiss lakes the strata or layers of the earth are bent down in a remarkable manner close to the lake, and they appear to plunge below its floor. A theory taught by Sir Andrew Ramsey, states that in the glacial period, when cold reigned supreme in the northern parts of the earth, the glaciers of the hills came into the plains, and meeting with impediments to their progress, ploughed up the earth and made the great lakes. There is no doubt that the Swiss lakes were filled with ice to a certain extent, for rocks were carried from one side to the other on ice; but there could be no movement in a mass of ice sufficient to gouge out the earth, in a hollow hundreds of feet deep; and if there were, the earth gougeu out could not be removed. Accordingly this theory, which may be true for small tarns and locks, and for some shallow valley like lakes, in the course of mountain streams, will not bold for the great lakes. —Science for AU.  ' The Rev. B. G. Johns, in The Quiver for November, says:—Wonderful as are all the works a..d ways of the Common Spider, and perfectly fitted as she is for all the varied chances of her life and the rearing of her brood on dry land, there is an9ther kind of insect—the Water-spider—whose art is even still more curious. Her nest, in fact, is built in the midst of water, and formed of air! She can not only swim, but is an admirable diver, and may often be seen hunting for a prey along the edge of the shore, and, having seized it, sodduly plunges down with it to the bottom of the water. And here it is that she contrives to build her house. Were it constantly wet, it would be uncomfortable enough; but she is wise enough and clever enough to make it as snug and secure as if on dry land. Having first spun some loose threads, she fastens them in all directions to the leaves of the water-plants as a framework for her chamber, over which she spreads a coat of clear varnish like liquid glass. This wonderful varnish, which issues from the middle of her spinnerets, easily contracts and expands, so that it a bole be made in it, it instantly closes up again. But how is she to get a whiff of air at the bottom of the water ? God, who taught the little creature to build her watery home, has taught her even a greater wonder. Having first covered the front of her body with the varnish (that makes it shine like quicksilver), in a trice she mounts up to the surface of the water, where, more wondrous still, sire seizes on a bubble of air, hides it under her coat of varnish, dives with it to the bottom, and primps it out into her dainty chamber, which is always kept mouth downwards, so that the air cannot escape. This little trip she repeats 10 or 12 times, until, in about 20 minutes, she has carried dowii enough air to fill her tiny room, where she can sit safe and dry in the midst of the water if need be, for many hours together without any further supply of air, and without a particle ef risk! What diving-bell made by man can equal this ? And where is the human diver who will rival the little spider in building under water a tenement safe, dry, and lasting ? If he laboured for 50 years, lie would be as far off as ever from accomplishing his task. Yet she was able to build her fairy palace wider the watery flood before she was a day old; and the very first she built was 8,11 absolutely and supremely complete as to surpas, all that the wisdom and skill of man can achieve!

THE PRINCE'S VISIT TO INDIA. One of the most remarkable fruits of the Prince of Wales's visit to India is the appointment recently made to the Military Secretaryship at Madras, due, it is loudly asserted in well-informed circles, to the personal influence t,f the Prince with the Duke of Buckingham. The officer chosen for this important post over the heads of his seniors, and in total disregard of the custom of the service. has, as far as we are informed, chiefly distinguished himself by his constant absence from regimental duties, and his remarkable feats :Is a sportsman. It was Colonel Michel, we are assured, who has been foremost in arranging the shooting. and hunting parties which have formed HO distinctive a feature in His Royal Highness's educational tour through our Indian empire.

THE LOSS OF THE MISLETOE. What Baron Bramwell said to the jury when charging. them upon the Alberta-Mistletoe collision was curiously perverted, and the perversion was s,) serious that, without waiting for an wToser, the learned judge deemed it right to send to Mr. Secretary Cross a correct report of those portions of his charge that had been incorrectly given to the public. It was alleged against the Baron that he had told the jury a verdict against the Alberta officers might pain the Qiieen. he did, but he said more, and the addition, which was omitted, was the more important part. What he did say wag—"" A verdict against the Alberta people might give pain where you would be sorry to give it. You must guard against this influenciag you, and if you feel a yeraict of manslaughter is right, so you must say."" Then it was said the Judge hal told the jury that they ought not to find a true bill against the officers in command of the Alberta because, as Englishmen, they ought to be proud that the Queen could go at a higher rate of speed than any private person. This, too, it inadequately reported. Baron Bramwell condemned distinctly the opinion of Captain Sullivan that the Royal yacht must ""necessarily"" go M a greater speed than usual when her Majesty is on board and he censured in terms about which there could be no mistake, the somewhat unwise statement of Captain Welch that the yachts ""gave him a great deal of trouble,"" on the express ground that the more trouble they give the more care he must take."" The charge, therefore, of servility against one of the most independent of Our Judges is thus satisfactorily disposed of.

So ardently attached to his acquaintances was the absentee that he actually called on one gentleman, in the same line of business as himself, when on his way to the railway station, and not only borrowed all the gold the lender had, but also benevolently cleared the till of every silver coin it contained. The defaulter was an official of a chapel in the outskirts of the town, and its affairs have since been ascertained to be in by no means so clear a condition as could be desired. "

The CHAIRMAN said he found that this was the case, and it was proposed to call the surveyor in, but upon Mr. Pearce being called he was not to be found. The CHAIRMAN : Leave it to the new Chairman. Mr. HODDER : We can't have a better one. The Collector's report stated that £951 184. Id. had been collected to the 20th of March. Mr. HOWARD observed that now was the time to press in all arrears. It was always best to press in • rate in the middle of a quarter than at the end. This was the IBA meeting of the old Board, but it is said to he more than probable the whole of the retiring memoers will be returned without opposition in April next. "

Mr. How.uta said the question had arisen in Weytnouth as to the ratelxtaks and vouchess. Here they had all their books anti vouchers, and he asked that the Board would be good enough to see how they stood. The CHAIRMAN supposed they had all been audited. THE SURVEYOR'S REPORT  Mentioned certain work as necessary to be done. As to  ...... :—Mr. S. Andrews had heard it said that 32 turns were required to bring up a pail of water. The CHAIRMAN had spoken to Mr. Roil, and never heard any complaint while the pump was in repair; the fault is, it is so often out of repair. Mr. E. COMBEN mid the complaint was against the pump when it was out of repair, and against tint watar who it was in repair. (lAughtei.) It IV3S g,inerally believed that the water is very valuable for some purposes: but the Board are waiting for plans for the pump. As to the road near the railway station. Hr. Howann remarked that it would be very useful to cam' a footpath from Mr. Hodsdon's past the entrance t. the gasworks, and so to the railway station. It well lie a great advantage to people coining into the Islaed, and give a better look on entraace to the place. Mr. E. COMBEN also spoke of the danger id preNlat to foot passengers from vehicles coming down and round the roads. Mr. G. ANDREWS proposed that the svrveyor be instructed to do the necessary curbing near the Victoria Hotel to the railway station under the superintendence of the Footpath Committee. Unanimously agreed to. The Surveyor was called in, and received instructions that, as to Old-hill, he was only to do very little.—He contended it was a very bad road; but the Chairman told him not to put down any old "" seedling,"" or it would in the tiry weather, all becutiw lust. —MAl:tuts-road, which also he had down for repair, it was agreed ought not to be done this time of year.—The Surveyor was also instructed to see that no obstruction is placed in Chesil-street from Messrs. Mitchell's Sawmills. ALLEGED NUISANCE FROM PIGS.  The Board went on to consider a letter received from the Local Government Board, enclosing a copy of a letter received from Mrs. Ann Winter, in which complaint was  made of a nuisance caused by a piggery near bet :premises. Jlrs. Winter's letter to the Chairman of the Uoveratueut  Board drew atteution to a ""meat nudanee wideli at present exists, it has il,me for more taut, three years,an.l of which she had complain.' to the met' ieal Milker of the Board, the inspector, the dell: to the Board. :WA his clerk. She hail also ref used to pay her local rates, and believed that tla. Board would not 401111111011 her because they were afraid of the facts becoming public. In con. elusion, Mrs. Mi inter appealed to the L....al Government Board to order the immediate removal of the piggery near her ;wend es. The letter of the Government Board asked for the observations of the Local Board on the subject. A letter from Dr. Parsons, tueilieal other, stated that he had clatoined the'pigsties without giving Mr. Sleeinau any prelioduary notice, and at various dews, and never fount any justfiable reason for complaint of their boing a nuisance. It was difficult to decide how near pigs may be kept to a dwelling-house without ally injurious at:et ; I.ut in Mr. Sleeman's case, the cleanliness of the sties removes all apprehension. Thu Cu AIRMAN had also inspected the place without notice, ;ma found the sties the cleanest he ever saw, and there was no manure outside ; Mr. Sleetnau buried it in the garden. The Inspector and Mr. ""lowan]) also bore testimony to the cleanliness of the place, though Mr. Howard said even for the look of the thing, he should not like pig-sties near his house. It was resolved to write to the Goverment Board that the sunject had previously had the consideration of the Board, that several members. the medical officer, and the inspector of the Board had frequently visited the pig-sties, and found that they were no nuisance. Mr. E. COM !lEN Dia& enquiry of the collector, and found that Mrs. Winter owes about two years' rates ; but she had not been summoned, as for IS months they had not summoned anybody. Now he was ordered to summon any one iii default. . . . . . .  Mr. MABEY, referring to the complaint against the pigsties, thought it would be advisable to get Parliament to pass an Act forbidding anybo.ly to eat pork. (Laughter.) "

In fact, the marvellous effects produced upon the mind and body of an Arab Sheik, who was impervious to all native medicinea, when I administered to him five COCKLE'S PILLS will never fade from may memory: and a friend of mine, who passed through the same district many months afterwards, informed me that my fame as a 'medicine man' had not died out, but that the marvellous cure was even then a theme of conversation in the bazaar.""

A collision of an alarming nature occurred on the Cambrian Railway, on Monday night. The passenger train which is due at Most Lane Junction at nine p.m. was proceeding to Aberystwith, and, when nearing CILIMO Station, it ran into a heavy goods train eoming from Machynlleth to Oswestry. The goods train was a very heavy one, drawn by two engine., and a collision ensued of a most alarming character. The three engines were badly damaged, and a composite London and North-Western Railway carriage next the passenger engine was smashed to piece., and mounted the passenger engine. The passenger train was also well laden, and many of the passengers came in for a severe shaking, and many were cut. The fireman of the passenger train—James Drake—was badly injured, and it is feared that his injuries will terminate fatally. The driver, David Hughes, sustained injuries to the leg, and Banks, the guard, was also hart. Earl Vane, the chairman of the company, was in his private saloon, in the mar of the train, and with the jerk was thrown from his seat and cut about the head. The saloon carriage ran back to Moat Lane crossing, a distance of nearly 54 miles, before it could be stopped, the coupling having become unfastened. The line was blocked until nearly eight o'clock the following morning, and much damage has been done. Drs. Parry and Shi. lda, of Caeraws and other medical gentlemeu were in attendance upon those passengers and employes of the company who required their services Tuesday last being the tint day of the Michaelmas term, the Equity and the Common Law Courts were opened at Westminster with the customary formalities. In the morning the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherley, entertained the judges and the leading members of the bar at breakfast at his private residence in Great George-.t rest. Afterwards His Lordship and the judicial body went in a procession of carriages to Westminster Hall, where a large assemblage of people had collected to see them pass along to their respective courts.  ROBBERIES BY A POST-OFFICE STAMPER. —The Leicester magistrates were occupied for a considerable time, on Tuesday, in the investigation of charges of robberies of post letters by a young man named John Clarke, a stamper, employed at the Leicester Post-office. The prisoner was eventually committed for trial at the assizes on two charges—first, for stealing a ""test"" letter, containing two half-sovereigns and 60 penny postage stamps, on the 21st of October; and, secondly, for stealing a needle-case, also the property of the Postmaster.Cteueral, on the 10th of August last. ANOTHER MURDER NEAR WOOD GREEN. On Tuesday morning, about half.past eight, a murder was committed in Blackstock lane near Wood Green. It appears that Henry James Tucker, George Clarke, and Henry May, carpenters, were at we! kin the neighbourneod. A man named Potter had left a gun loaded in one of the houses in which they were workhg, telling them not to interfere with it. After breakfast May stood on the staircase, and Tucker took up the gun and told May to prepare to die, and shot him dead on the spot. The prisoner on being arrested, said that he had done it ""for a lark."" EXTENSIVE ROBBERY OF PLATE.—A somewhat remarkable plate robbery was investigated, on Monday, at Bow-street. A youth of 18, named Walter Smith, was employed as a footman in the family of Mr. Bowstead, army agent, Craven-street, and it happened that in November, 1867, a box fall of plate, belonging to a lady, named White, was entrusted to Messrs. Brice and Bowstead for safe eustody. Smith was occasionally visited by an elder brother, 30 years of age, a clerk. The chest WWI returned in September last, when it was found that the lock had been tampered with, and plate to the value of £250 abstracted. The case was then put into the hands of the poloe, who discovered some of the property, sold to sioren. smiths, and thus obtained a clue. The prisoners on being taken into custody (one in the service of a gentleman in Cumberland) made admissions which justified the magistrates in remanding them for farther inquiry.  EUROPEAN Ls/init.= COMPANY.—Sefore Vice. Chancellor Malice, on Tnesday, Mr. Glasse, Q.C., tippled on behalf of the directors of the European Assurance Company, for an injunction to restrain Mr. Bentley, of Paternoster•row, from publishing a certain statement with reference to that Company. The learned counsel stated that the defendant had under the pretence of being a registrar published a certain absti act winch was highly prejudicial to the interests of the European Assurance Company. The defendant had a ready been before the magistrate, and charged with libel in publishing the statement. The Defendant, wh.., appeared in person, asked for time to answer. Ho stated that the publicatio of the abstract complained of had entirely ceased. The Vice. Chancellor, in order to give defendant an opportunity of consulting a solicitor, adjourned the c ore, the &fondant undertaking to refrain from publishing the paper in the meantime. THE ""TIMES"" AND THE HOUNSLOW MURDER CASE.—On Tuesday, in Banco, before the Lord Chief Justice, and Mr. Justice Mellor, Mr. Justice Black. burn, and Mr. Justice Lush, Mr. Littler moved for a rule to show cause why Mr. Francis Goodlake, prin. ter and publisher of the Times newspaper, should not be committed for contempt of court. Mr. Littler said a man named Smith was accused of murdering  _ li, wife at Hounslow during last month, and was subsequently found guilty of manslaughter, but there being great provocation, Mr. Justice Lush only sea. tenced him to nine months' imprisonment. Soon after that a leading article appeared in the Times, which the learned counsel contended was Most malls dons, nod had done the character of Smith consider. able injury. By this article he contended that the publisher had committed contempt of court. In reply to a question from Mr. Justice Blackburn, Mr. Littler said he could Not say that Smith had sustained any substantial damage, nor could he give any premient showing an application on similar gro Lids. The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said they hail been asked to grant a criminal information with. out evidence that there had been malice on the part of the defeudank It was quite possible that the wiitcr of the artiole, with tire intention of repressing the wrongs of women, which unfortunately came of en before the courts, had gone out of his way and acted rashly in making the observations ho had, but thew was no proof that. what ho had written was wraten with individual malice.

OVER £lOO STOLEN.  One of the most daring and evidently pre-meditated burglaries that has occurred in Bridgend was enacted on Sunday evening and caused a great sensation on Newcastle Hill. The circumstances of the matter are specially singular, and they furnish several links which would indicate that the perpetrator or perpetrators was a person or persons either intimately acquainted with the house or possessed of some knowledge of the financial resources of the inmates of the domicile which was forcibly entered on Sunday evening. Mr William Lewis, a haulier, residing with his wife in a house at the top of Newcastle Hill, a man who is much respected as a hard working and steady workman, left his home at five o'clock on Sunday evening for the purpose of attending to some duties at the Tabernacle Chapel, in Adarestreet, prior to the service being held. Mrs Lewis left the house at half-past six to attend chapel and before leaving securely locked the front door and extinguished the light. The house, it may be stated, has no back entrance. There is a window overlooking the gardens and meadows at the back. This was all secured when Mrs Lewis left the house. Mr Lewis and his wife returned about eightl o'clock, and presently Mrs Lewis perceived a draught coming from the direction of the window. She was at a loss to account for this and immediately went to the window, an to her great surprise discovered that a pane of glass was broken and the sash sprung. Her suspicions were at once aroused, and she instantly discerned that several things in the kitchen were disarranged. She became cognisant of the alarming fact that the house had actually been broken into, and, in company with her husband, she at once procured a light and went to examine the bedroom. The indications here verified in an unmistakeable degree the fears she had entertained. The wearing apparel con• tamed in three large boxes were literally strewn all over the room, and a hurried examination of the various articles proved that the thief or thieves had undertaken a more enterprising mission than stealing clothing. Mr and Mrs Lewis the* examined a box which is usually doubly and triply locked. These precautions would lead one to imagine that the box contained something valuable. In a drawer in this box was deposited a leather bag which contained over one hundred sovereigns. The accumulation of this sum was the outcome of persistent and life-long energy and hard work, and was placed there for immediate business transactions. This box was broken open, and a skeleton key was left in one of the locks. Upon opening the drawer the leathern bag ' was found entirely empty, and not a trace of any money could be found. Anxious enquiries were made of the neighbours, but only one person seems to have noticed the house. This person is Mrs Davies, a neighbour, who lives on the opposite side of the road. About half-past seven she noticed a light in the bedroom, and thinking this somewhat strange she remarked to her husband how early Mrs Lewis was going to bed. Nothing more appears to have been noticed. There can be no doubt that an entrance must have been effected through the back window. There is a gateway leading to the garden from the road, and an entrance could be made to the rear of the pren.ises and the back window easily reached. Another ingress could be effected to the back of these premises, by crossinv fences and voing across Mr Riley's field. Footmarks have been traced along the garden and terminate at the fence. Mr Lewis has resided at the house for 48 years. He has invariably been in the habit of attending the Tabernacle Chapel every Sunday evening, at which place he is a faithful member. Much sympathy is felt in the neighbourhoad. The police are diligent in their search for the miscreant, or miscreants and a hope is generally expressed that he or they will be brought to speedy justice. "

Taibach is one of them. The inhabitants would have possessed much more general knowledge, and some of them undoubtedly would have spent hundreds of hours less in public houses and at the corners of the streets if there had been a convenient room, containing good books, a few newspapers, monthlies, Bee., with a comfortable fire to sit by, to enjoy an hour now and then during the long winter evenings, after the toil and fatigue of the day. There are plenty of means in the place to get such a thing comfortably, and then are gentlemen and tradesmen, if brought to feel an interest in the matter, and to study the happiness of the neighbourhood and the elevation of the working classes, who would accomplish the affair before the end of the year, and without feeling much of the burden, for most of the inhabitants would cooperate if the subject were properly mooted.

Mr. Lokie proposes carrying on a singing class during the winter months, which will meet in the school room of the United Methodist Free Church, every Wednesday and Friday evening. Any persons desirous of becoming acquainted with the art of singing by music will be gladly received as members of this class. ENORMOUS CATCHES OF HERRINGS During this week the herring fishery, which was looked upon as being almost over, many fishermen having put away their nets for the year, has suddenly revived, the whole fleet of herring cobles now regularly returning with large takes of fish, some with as many as two lasts and a half, (60,000 fish). The prices have only ruled low, (Is. 10d. to 2s. 6d. per 100), but it is computed that about £lOOO has been paid during the past week for herrings alone.  Tim VOCAL SOCIIITY.—As will be seen from an announcement in another column the first concert of the present session of this Society-will take place on Wednesday, Dec.. 22nd, when Handel's "" Acis and Galatea,"" will be performed. The Cantata is well known, and we have no doubt will be as well rendered as those previously given by the Society under the painstaking direction of Mr. Camidge. The glees are also said to be more than usually attractive, so that altogether a most interesting concert is looked forward to. Places must be booked next Saturday.  THE LAT& ROYAL Visrr.—Mrs. Furby, the publisher of"" Brief Sketches of Bridlington Quay,"" by the late Mr. Thomas Cape, of Bridlington, having forwarded a copy of the work to His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, has received the following letter : Naval Reserve, 1, New Street, Spring Gardens, S.W. 29th 1"" BELDAM,-I am desired by His The Duke of Edinburgh, to acknowledge of your letter of the 23rd inst., and to the book containing the aecount of Oat Bridlington, which book His been pleased to accept—lam,' servant, "

Each year the sum total is larger, and one cannot but admire the hard and constant work that is represented. All through the year thought and action are directed towards this annual Sale, and the stalls were tilled with a really beautiful and valuable assortment of articles of all kinds. There were over 70 stall-holders and helpers, and over 100 sat down to luncheon, the company including the Mayor and Mayoress, Councillor J. T. and Mrs. Hill, Alderman Rennard. Alderman Grimshaw, Councillors Lambert, Nightingale, Collinson, etc. Dr. Pride dispensed with any formal opening this year and business was brisk from the outset, the large room being crowde the greater part of the day.

The nomination for the borough and county of 2befba took place on Tuesday. Shortly before two o'clock Mien two Liberal candidates and their supporters proceeds& to the Townhall ; the conservative candidate, with his-. friends, soon after made their appearance, and from that; time till the appearance of the Sheriff, cheering, bandy- • ing of election jokes, and confusion prevailed. The 7 High Sheriff, Augustus Priestly Hamilton, Esq., accompanied by the Under Sheriff, entered the room about 2 o'clock, and was greeted with loud cheers. The = proclamation and the Bribery Act having been read amidst much interruption, and the question asked as to • whether anyone had a candidate to propose to serve in L the ensuing parliament, G. BELBIN, E,q., who was received with loud cheers, . said he begged to propose as a fit and proi,er person Henry Danby Seymour, Esq. (Cheers.) Mr. Seymour • was no stranger to them. He had repre,ented their interests for the past 15 years with a diligence, a zeal, and a con•istency which he was sure must have given them every satisfAction. They had elected him on four :different occasions, and he was sure if they again reposed their confidence in him he would do his utmost not only on behalf of the town and trade of Poole but give his vote for such measures as would be for the welfare of the whole nation. (Loud cheers ) Mr. WOOD briefly seconded the nomination, amidst hie es and cheers... _  Mr. 'Plasstfrtr, (chairman of the Liberal committee) then rose, and amidst considerable interruption fions a 4 large party at the further end of the room, proposed Mr. Waring as a fit and proper person. [A. voice : : Another nominee r] Mr, Wanhill : No, Mr. Stickland, don't be ashamed to hold up your head; not another • nominee. Mr. Waring was solicited by their corn- • mittee to offer himself, and it was only to that coin- mittee he was answerable. (Loud cheers and interruption.) [A voice: Any more writs T] They could not expect, and they did not expect the confidence of their opponents. If the choice of the electots should rest on their opponent they should bow to that decision, and he could assure them that they would use no • nnkind remarks; but at the same time he could . not pasts over entirely the unfortunate speech delivered in that hall a night or two since. He could not but . deeply regret and condemn the attacks made on Mr. . Wariness efraracter and position. (Hear, hear.) Mr. . Waring did that which was the only honourable course • under the circumstances for him to do. He brought it . before his committee, who requested him to require a retraction of thecharges' and an apology from Mr. Halv, and if he had done that all would have been well, and Mr. Waring would have been satisfied. (Cheers.) Bat he had not done so, and therefore Mr. Waring had I been compelled, most reluctantly, to take the only, course open to him to maintain his own and the charac- • ter of the firm he represented. (Cheers and hisses.)— Believing that Mr. Waring was a man who would do • all the good in his power for the town of Poole and for the general welfare:of the nation, he had much pleasure • in proposing him. Mr. MULLET said it WAS with very great pleasure beseconded the nomination of Mr. Waring. (A Voice: ""He don't reckon you up as Hely does?) He believed that by returning Mr. Waring to parliament they would best serve their own interests. [Here the speaker was so much interrupted that he could not proceed for some tim s] Order being partially restored, he remarked thathe had never 'known an election lost or won in thasr. room. He had no doubt that, on the followin:wrllys. thee would, by their votes, show which candidaesewas• b s', and he had no doubt the choice would fall on Seymour, and Mr. Waring. (Cheers and hisses.) W. Apr!, Esq., then proposed Mr. Stephen Lewen-,. whom he highly recommended on acconnt of his cons nection with the town, and the interest he took in llst prosperity. This nomination was seconded by Mr.. Pettit. who slid he had great pleasure in doing so, be-cause Mr. Lewen was a Conservative to the back bone.. (Cheers and hisses.) It was for them to consider whether they would have their ancient borough represented by an independent man or by the nominees of the Canford estate. (Considerable interruption and marks of disapi royal.) They, the Liberals, hoped to secure the reaturn*/ Mr. Seymour and Mr. Waring, but they must gii e , way to a better man, Mr. Lswen. They must make room for one for the town, instead of two for the Canford interest. [Cries of ""Sit down, sit down."" What about the meeting at the Bull yesterday ?""] The : interruption here became so general that the speakers appealed to the reporters present to take down what he; wished to say, which was to the effect that he con-sidered the Canford family very liberal with what was, not their own, but not s with what was, that its wasi robbing the town of its harbour dues, and that it hadi been quite long enough represented in Parliament. No other candidate presenting himself, H. D. SETMOUR, Esq., who was loudly cheered, saidl his remarks would be very brief. They had done himi the honour of electing him on four previous occasions,. and he again asked them to continue that favour. Hu. hail endeavoured to do his duty, not only to them as. his con•tituents, but to the country at large. The quest ionfor them to decide was whether they w(nil retry ILI a member to the House who would support Lord Pelmet— ston, Mr. Gladstone and Earl Russell, or would they return as their member one pledged to Lord Derby, Mr. Disraeli, and Lord Maltnesbury. Mr. Seymour then referred to Lord Stanley's speech at King's Lynn, and then remarked that during the past six years their taxes: had been considerably reduced, the country had been kept out of foreign was, and many measures passed for• the advancement of the social well-being of the people.. He was sure that those at the other end of the room, who were causing so much interruption, did not calmly consider what they were about, or they would certainly• assist in maintaining in power that ministry which hat done so much for their welfare, in reducing taxatior, and who were prepared to do even more. (Loud cheers.) Mr. Seymour then made a slight allusion to the charge brought against him of being in the Canford interest,, which he denied, and concluded by soliciting the support. of the electors. (Loud cheers.) C. WARING, Esq., wholwas received with cheers frornt. friends and hisses from opponents, said he depended on the independent views'of the people whether he was. elected or rejected. He then alluded to and most strongly denounced the accusations made against him by Mr. Thily, The firm he represented had no need of a public vindiscation of its honour. It was known all over the world. A charge more gross had never been made than that which had been made against him, and if he had been guilty of that with which he had been charged he should have been in prison long as°. He believed Mr. Haly had been a barrister, and there was a saying that when an advocate had a bad case he should bully the plaintiff But that line of conduct would not do at elections, ana the very kind way he hail been received, the expressicra of contempt and disgust by the townspeople at the conduct of the gentlenan—if he could call him a gentleman—by whom he had been assailed, proved that this electors of Poole, whatever their political opinions, would give no countenance to a man who sought by vile slander to injure his opponent in their estimation There was a Spanish proverb, which says that curses a a like young chickens, sure to come home to roost, nod such he believed would be the case with the infamous slanders to which he had referred. At any rite Mr. Hely should have the opportunity of proving his charges before a tribunal of his countrymen. With regard to the charge that he was a nominee of the Canford estate, he positively denied it. And as regarded Mr. Seymour he had no business connection whatever with him. So much for the personal mattes introduced into the election. But they were tcs determine who should be their member not on personal but publio grounds. They had to decide whether the party of progress, the party who had given liberty, and were the promoters of plenty, liberty of the subject, and freedom of religion should govern the country, or whether those who represented a policy of stagnation should again be restored to power. Mr. Waring concluded, amidst loud applause, by stating that he would so far as was consistent with parliamentary business do his utmost towards the support of the town and trade of Poole. C. LEWIN, Esq., who was loudly cheered, said that be came before them to solicit their suffrages as .one who would not only do, as he had hitherto done, all he could for the interests and well-being of the town, but also as a supporter of Lord Derby. The very littering s'atetnents put forth by his opponents proved that he had the best wishes of his fellow-townsmen, and therefore he hardly needed to speak on that point. If returned to Parliament as one of their representatives, he should go to support the reduction of taxation, not only locally but generally, and had he been a member when the Union Chargeability Bill was brought before the House, he should have voted for it, as he considered it was one of the best measures ever passed. He would like to ask where was Mr. Seymour when that measure was discussed. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Lewin then referred to the Danish war, and asked if it was manly or nob:e to act as the Government had done in that cas ; first to bully, and then retreat like cowards. He also commented on the wars in Japan, China, and Nile Ztmland, which reflected no lionour dn Englane. He . . "

Hugmore Lane, near Wrexham, is the scene of a natural phenomenon of alsingular character. Recently, Mr. Charles Edwards, of Hugmore Farm, commenced to sink a well within a couple of yards of his house. After sinking through the surface soil he got into a solid bed of clay, through which he sank over ten yards, and while the man was still at work the water burst in about four yards above his head, and he had to escape as rapidly as possible. The well filled in a very short time, and then ran over in a regular stream, bringing with it a large quantity of quidksand. Every effort has been made to stop it, but hitherto without avail. The removal of the sand has caused a subsidence of the ground on which the house and part of the outbuildings stand, rendering them uninhabitable, and they will have to be rebuilt.. A large staff 4 men have been engaged in filling the well, the material used being large shines, embedded in hydraulic) lime, but this has proved of no avail, and the torrent still rushes on. "

They had a voice in the appointment of those who distributed the munci pal income of the country, amounting to about £20,000,000, and she contended that they ought snot° have a voice in appointing the men who had, to spend the Imperial incoine, which amounted to about £70,000,000.

John Neville, tranter, of Kinson.—A claim of £3 174.—Mr. Trevanion for plaintiff, whose case, as dearly proved by himself, his groom (George Thornhill), and an old man named Buttress, was as follows :—On the 2nd of April last Dr. Philpots. accompanied by his groom, was driving from Parkstone to Poole, and whilst descending a hill he saw a string of three tranter's carts approaching. The drivers of the first two carte were by the side of their horses, and they made way for the plaintiff's trap, but the defendant's cart continued on the wrong side of the road, the defendant being some yards behind. Plaintiff saw that a collision was inevitable, and shouted to the defendant and pilled his own trap close to the kerb, but the defendant's cart ran into the trap and smashed it, and threw plaintiff and his groom out. The amount claimed was simply the cost of repairing the trap and harness, and defendant admitted at the time of the colliston that no was in mutt, and said he would pay the damage. On measuring the road it was found that there Were only Ilse feet of road between the wheel of defendants cart and the kerb-stone ror tho plaintiff's trap to pains, whilst there was plenty of room on the other dude of toe road for a couple of vehicles to pasa—There Vilbe virtually no defence, and the defendant was ordered to pay toe claim in instalments of ill a  _ month. _ Donovan v.

Luke Morris, of Bonniemouth. —A claim of £1 10a, for the hire of a tent at the Bournemouth Regatta. —Mr. Trevanion for plahaiff.—Mr. Gillard, the plaintiff's manager, said the original contract he entered into with defendant's wife was that the tent was to be erected the day previous to the Regatta, and he made arrangements for this to be done. A day or two before the Regatta, however, the defendant celled on him and countermanded this order, and said the Coraniissionera had prohibited the erection of any. tents on the sands till after eight o'clock on the morning of the Regatta. He W 55 quite prepared to carry out the original contract, but he had great difficulty in obtaiaing a conveyance to take the tent to Bournemouth on the morning of the Regatta. He saw the tent leave Poole shortly after nine o'clock.— Tom Hiscock, who went to Bournemouth with the tent, said he had got there about quarter pestle o'clock and had the tent erected by about 11 o'clock. Defendant's wife kept the tent longer at night to make up for the time lost in the,rnorning, and it.was not taken down till between 11 and 12, whilst other people's were taken down by eight or nine o'clock.—Mrs. Harris said according to the contract the tent should have been at Bournemouth by six o'clock, but it was not ready for her till half-past one, and her goods were damaged by the rain and she lost a deal of money by the delay.—She called Mr. French, the beach keeper to the Conimisaioners. who said the tents could have been erected at any hour on the morning of the Regatta.

Barry Prost, of Poole, v. Robert Patsy, of Poole.—'A claim of 4a, for a bushel of sprats.—The defence was that the sprats were so small as to be unsaleable, and they were returned to plaintiff. —Verdict for defendant William Carter, brick manufacturer, of Poole, v. John Nethertote, builder of Bournemouth.—A claim n of Lilt. id. or a load of bricks.—Mr. Travers, who appeared for the defence, said the bricks were supplied by Alfred Carter, plaintiff's brother, who owed the defendant .261 10s. 91, and the order was given to help work out the debt.— Mr. Travers said his client sent to Alfred for the bricks on the 6th of September lest, and he produced the printed delivery note, which bore Alfred's name. —Mr. Trevanion, who appeared for plaintiff, said Alfred Carter formerly carried on business in a large way as a brick manufacturer on the same premises as the plaintiff now occupied, but he left the town some time ago, and his father paid his creditors a dividend of 7a. 6.1. in the 2, some Ss. op lia, of which came out of his own pocket. Plaintiff supplied the bricks since Alfred went away, and defendant must have known of the ehange.—Plaintiff was called and said the bricks supplied to defendant belonged to him and were manufactured by him, and the defendant knew that his brother had left--Defendant was sworn and said his father and he had business transactions with Alfred Carter and he with them. He did not haveany notice of Alfred giving up business, and he did not believe that his father did, or he wopld have shown Its to him. He sent for the load of bricks on the 6th of September to help work out the debt, at his father's suggestion and he did not then know that Alfred had left. His father had since died.— In cross-examination by Mr. Trevanion defendant said he owed Alfred Carter about 210, leaving £4O due to him. The Judge gave a verdict for the amount claimed forthwith, without costs. AN OLD DZBT. Milling and Marston„ brewers, of Poole, v. Job Short, formerly a publican in Poole.—The plaintiff's lately sued the defendant for a debt of over £4O contracted at the time of the Crimean War, and as he allowed judgment to go by default he was now before the Court under • judgment summons. Mr. Trevanion appeared for the defence, and said defendant had no means to pay. Defendant was examined by Mr. Travers, who appeared for plaintiffs, and said he kept the Gas Tavern till Ist of August last. Whatever furniture belonged to him he left in the house. Everything that was removed from the house belonged to his son-in-law, who now occupied the New London Tavern. and kept him out of kindness, as he was too old to work. He bade paasseesory title to • piece of garden ground near the Gar house, but he gave the land to his son-in-law about six years ago. He formerly rented the land of Mr. Wise, but he had not been asked for any rent for 16 yeara—Mr. Travers offered to take the piece of land, and risk die defendant's title, in settlement of the claim, but Mr. Trevanion said he could not agree to this without consulting defendant's son-in-law, by whom he was engaged. —The case was then adjourned till the next Court.

To the Editor.  Sir,—Doubtless, ere this, many of your readers have seen or heard that there are parties who would be glad to disqualify many voters in the future who may require medical relief. Be that as it may, I sin one who considers there are many who ought to be (and I hope will be) disqualified, not because of medical relief; but my reason is this—"" In Sweden a man who is seen drunk three times loses his right to vote."" In this country of ours drunkenness is so prevalent in many towns and villages, and seems to defy the officers of justice. Surely, then, England, with all her virtues, will not allow Sweden's example to pass by unnoticed. It does not say convicted once, twice, or thrice—nothing of the kind—it is to be seen drunk. Now is the time for those interested in the suppression of the liquor traffic to do all in their power to disqualify by some means or other those who will abuse instead of use the liquor. Sir Stafford Northcote once said—"" The evils of cfrunkenness become more and more patent. Every day we examine into the matter we are more and more impressed with the frightful mischiefs which arise from it, arid the conscience of the oountry is fairly aroused on the subject."" Knowing full well that such a state of things is a disgrace to our country, I hope all those who possibly can will strive to make the law effectual on this voting question, and have it so framed as to disqualify the thousands who habitually spend their  nd  wer ited 1 to ion. yen sine  the r to .ury ible  nvn fore l in ily,  cash and leisure hours at tap-rooms and alehouses. A ober people cannot permit such to take part in Kislsting for the masses, as they know full well, if the blind lead the blind, what will be the result.— Trusting theqe,few rambling remarks will be the cause qettilig dur political organisations to consider and il weigh over the same tti a suceesd ife UI M* Rut, sir, yours respectfully, ONE OF TIM Two MILLIONS.

A TRUMPERY Cass.—At the Borough Police-court n Monday, before the Mayor (Alderman Gregory), °Amerman Nirme, Mr. H. Burden, and Mr. F. Lock.— George Wilshire (for whom Mr. Huatable appeared) was summoned for assaulting Robert George Newberry, a child aged eight years, at Fordington.— Defendant pleaded guilty, and on his behalf Mr. Huitable expressed deep regret that in a moment of irritation and under great provocation, he forgot himself and took the law into his own hands. The assault was committed owing to the stone-throwing nuisance, he having been hit in the head with a large stone, and thinking it wail_ the boy who did it, he struck him with a lathe.—The Mayor said the magistrates had considered the case, and they thought it would be met by his paying the costs (65.) He was cautioned, however, not to take the law into his own hands in the future. BANK HOLIDAY DRUNKENNISS.—Robert Williams, blacksmith, pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly in All Saints' parish on Bank Holiday.—The Bench took a lenient view of the case, and let him off with paying the cost (40.)—Another smith, named Hails, was charged with a similar offence on the following day.—He, too, was ordered to pay the  costs.

White, stationed at Dorchester, said he found defendant sleeping behind some ricks in Mr. Lock's field on the Weymouth-road. He told him he had been in the Militia and had no money, and could not get any lodgings.—Defendant told the magistrate he had spent all the money he received on leaving the Militia, and his master at Frampton would not take him back. He had tried to enlist in the army.—Colonel Bingham cautioned the lad to keep himself out of trouble, and discharged him.

The culprit is a Conservative, a clergyman, and an absentee. A large proportion of his property consists of appropriated common land, from which he derives either rent or rectorial tithes. He has just sold to the railway company a considerable slice of land at the snug figure of seven times its agricultural value. Their share of the burden of this unearned increment his neighbours will, of course, have to bear in high traffic charges to recoup the company for their expenditure. This price, moreover, is more than twenty times the value the land bore when it Was taken from the peasants (to whom a piece of common is half a living) and conveyed,to:this gentleman's ancestors ; and the increase in value is due to the labour which generations of tenants have bestowed Upon the land. The new railway 'station is exactly a mile from a district of hard-working people, some of Whose names have been associated with the spot for centuries. Bat to get to the station these people will have to carry their rode over a hilly and circuitous road of two miles and a quarter, or takeby a ti two still of to do the work o omfiftw.on e, and g are two roads on this gentleman's land which come Within 500 yards:of each other. If these loose ends were joined, they would foim a reasonably direct road to the new station. Their owner has been memorialised, by a paper containing over fifty signatures,!to connect' these two:roads, but he ""does not "",'•ee how it would pay him to do so."" So the poor inntlers,nwho;pay his rent and tithes, will have no benefit out of the new railway, all because the landlord will not give a stray hundred pounds out of his lucky haul jor the good of the neighbourhood which ttede him..'; One of his family is a candidate in the koomervative interest, for the Parliamentary representation of one of the new constituencies in an adjoining county.-- W.M.N.

THE ODDFELLOWS AND THEIR FUNRRAL In discussing on Friday in the A.M.C. the question of establishing compulsory district funeral funds, as to which the directors recommended that all future members' contributions for funeral benefit should be paid over to district funeral funds, and that the contributions of existing members should be arranged according to the proved liability of each lodge • but each scheme must be approved by the directors,' Mr. Woodeson (Portsmouth) spoke strongly in favour of district funeral funds, and urged that they should, on a valuation, have assets equal to the liabilities, the same as lodge sick funds.—Mr. Sandon (North London) spoke against the directors' proposals, which were supported by Mr. Tunstall (Liverpool), and by Mr. Joshua Holmes (London), but . Crowe (Devizes) strongly opposed the project, on the ground that the levy system provided the necessary funds before they were required.—Past Grand Walton (Southampton) stated that one lodge in his district under the equal levy system had for death claims drawn £4OO more from the district funeral fund than it contributed; the difference had to be paid by younger lodges, some of which, consequently, had deficiencies.—Mr. Coles (Stoney Stratford) asked why had they come to torment them before their time? That was said by one who was tormented by a devil. (Laughter and cheers.) The ""devil"" by which the Manchester Unity was tormented was the equal-levy system and they desired the ship should be driven out and perish in the sea of oblivion. (Laughter and cheers.) He trusted the directors would not prophecy smooth, but sound things.—An amendment by Mr. Gardener (Reading) for striking out the directors' recommendations was rejected by an immense majority.—A demand for the votes to be recorded was refused by the meeting, and the cheering was renewed.--On its being decided that the directors should only be paid the prescribed guinea per day whilst actually absent from home engaged on Unity business, at the request of the Grand Master it was decided six hours and a half should represent an ordinary day. It was explained that this would detain the directors in Manchester occasionally more than a week. Subsequently Deputy-Grand Master Grimes was elected Grand Master. For the post of Deputy-Grand Master Mr. Stockall (North London) polled 176; Mr. Rust (Lynn), 157; and Mr. Campkin (Cambridge ) 60 • and Mr. Rust retiring, Mr. Stockall was elected.—Subsequently Stafford obtained 171 votes on a poll for the town to hold the A.M.C. next year; Dover, 127; Gloucester, 79 ; and Bradford, 113. Stafford was unanimously selected.—Mr. James Curtis (Brighton) was unanimously re-appointed Parliamentary_ agent. The directors elected were :—Rust (Lynn), Bennett (Chester), Pownall (Woolwich), Walton (Southampton), Cox (Stafford), Holmes (London). Three more having to be elected the A.M.C. sat till 3.15 on Saturday morning to finish the election' fresh balloti in ng papers having to be printed. Four followed the first ballot with no result. The fifth ballot returned Eastwood, of Blackburn, a new man, and Inglis, re-elected. Outram and Schofield were about to be put up to a sixth ballot, when the latter, who had the lowest votes, and said he had held office as director for 33 years, retired. THE DICKMAN cHORAL FESTIVAL.—The festival of the Diocesan Choral Association, which takes place in Salisbury Cathedral to - day, has promise of being I the most successful (from a musical point of view) that has trier taken place since the organization of the association. Holy Trinity choir will be one of the few complete choirs that will take part, a fact which, considering the difficult nature of the music, does great credit to the choirmaster, Mr. T. M. Morgan. The only other complete choirs, we believe, are the Cathedral, Wimborne Minster, Warminster, and Gillingham, and the remainder of the chorus (which will number nearly 300 voices) is made up of individual singers from the choirs of Holy Trinity (Weymouth), St. John (Weymouth), Beammster, Wareham, Kingston, Brcedwey, and othhr choirs in the diocese. The chorus will thus be composed of the best singers throughout the diocese, and while amply large to give a sufficient volume of sound, will not be unwieldy as in the case of the festival last year, when over three thousand singers werepresent. Most,praiseworthy enterprise has been shown in obtaining an orchestra which s hal at once be efficient and in tune with the organ. The association have secured the services of 13 members of the orchestra that always take part in the great choral festivals held in St. Paul's. On these London players, who are all well-known professors of their special instruments will devolve the duty of leading the most important sections of the orchestra, and 'thus keeping in time and tune the many excellent local professionals and amateurs with which the band will be reinforced, the full strength of the orchestra being 41. Mr. C. F. South will preside at the organ, and Dr. Martin, of St. Paul's, will be the conductor. The followings a list of those who will form . the orchestra :—First violins (7)—Mr. Easton, leader St. Paul's Cathedral Orchestra; Mr. W. Stone, leader of Weymouth Oratorio Society and Dorchester Vocal Association; Mr. Whitehead Smith, leader of Wimborne Orchestral Society; Mr. A. Foley, Mr. Woodrow, and Mr. T. Leach, Sarum Choral Society; and Mr. E. A. Ffooks, Wimborne. Second violins (s)—Dr. F. Coates, Sarum Choral Society; Mr. Beck and Mr. Quick, Wimborne Orchestral Society; the Rev. 0. P. Cambridge and Mr. T. J. Leaman. Violas (4)—Dr. Mann, Mus. Dom ; Mr. W. Harding, Sarum Choral Society • Mr. Boyton Smith, conductor Dorchester Vocal A'ssociation ,• and the Rev. S. Nichols.

The present festival is a new departure, and one upon which the Diocesan Choral Association is to be heartily congratulated. Through the energy of its able secretary, the Rev. W. Miles Barnes, arrangements have been made to hold an annual festival for the future in the cathedral, and that to take place on Thursday next will form the first of the new series.  TOWN Comma, Tuesday.—tiegeni The Mayor (Alderman Gregory), Alderman Curme, Alderman Durden; Councillors H. Durden, A. H. Lock, H. A. Ifettoble, and F. Lock; Mr. H. Symonds (AssistantTown Clerk), Alt: IV, Thorns& (Borough Surveyor).— A memorial was presented from merchants and others attending the Corn Exchange, asking that blinds be placed on the western side of the Corn Exoltsme to obviate the great glare of the sun. It was thouglif an, extra coating of whiting would meet the necessity of the eatei and it was agreed this should be done.—lt was decided to stop the Muffle hrongli the fair field on fair days,—A letter was read from Mr, G. Symonds (auctioneer), complaining of the mismanagement of the market, and renewing his apheation for a ring ' in the western corner of the ground, for which.he was prepared to pay.—Mr. Huxtable proposed ""That the , matter be referred to the General Purposes Committee, and that the Clerk of the Markets and Messrs. Duke and Mr. Symonds be asked to attend,""—A further letter was read from Mr. Thorne claiming compensa- I tion for loss sustained, amounting to 240, by the closing of the market ground crates, the result of which had been his horses had to stand out In the rain for some time, and threatening to take further steps to enforce it.—Mr. Huxtable said he should like to know how he made up the claim. It was utterly unreasonable, and he suggested they should let him take his own course. A sovereign would be ample compensation.—Mr. Alderman Curme also suggested they should take no notice of it,. and it was agreed the claim should not be entertamed.—The County Surveyor's report as to the condition of the main roads in the borough was presented, and it was laid on the table,—The Fire Brigade.—The General Purposes Committee reported as followt: "" Your committee have had under their consideration the revision of the scale of charges made for the services of the Fire Brigade, and recommend for adoption by the Council the accompanying rules for regulating the brigade and the scale of charges embodied in such rules. The committee have had before them the rules and charges in force in other towns, and have proceeded chiefly upon the scale of charges adopted in the borough of Guildford. In compliance with a memorial received from the members of the brigade, as well as on the recommendation of the superintendent, the committee have adopted one uniform scale of remuneration for the men, whether employed in the town or the adjoining ,neighbourhood, the payments being regulated by the number of hours engaged. The superintendent recommended the purchase of a chimney extinguisher and divided breeching, to be used with the hose in cases of fire, and authority has been given for the purchase of the extinguisher, but the committee are of opinion the divided breeching is not requisite. Mr. Coward also recommended the supply of additional hydrants in South-street and Charlesstreet, but this the Committee thought unnecessary. Mr. Coward also reported that the pressure of water from the hydrant opposite Mr. Grassby's house, in the Maumbury-road, was insufficient for fire purposes, but the committee did not think it necessary to do anything in regard thereto, the locality referred to being an outlying part of the town."" The following was the scale of charges and rules made by the Dorchester Town Council (acting as the Urban Sanitary Authority for the borough) for the Fire Brigade:I.—The Brigade shall consist of a superintendent and foreman-fireman, appointed by the Sanitary Authority, and sixteen firemen; appointed by the superintendent. 2.—Each fireman shall obey the orders of the superintendent and foreman-fireman, and shall be res Poll• I sible to the superintendent for the due preservation of all articles issued to him, bemg the property of the Town Council, fair wear and tear only excepted. 3.—The Brigade shall be called out for the purpose of trying and examining the engines and appointments of the Brigade at least once a month, and the remuneration payable by the Town Council to the Brigade for each such practice or examination shall be one shilling for each member present and employed. 4. The remuneration for attendance at a fire (paid by the Town Council, or received from any other source) shall be in accordance with the following scale :—For the use of the engine per day, £2 25.; in addition for horses where the distance travelled does not exceed five miles from the borough, £2 125.; where such distance exceeds five miles, £3 12s. For the remuneration of the Brigade, as follows, superintendent, 7s. for three hours, and 2s. 6d. per hour afterwards; foreman, 7s. for three hours, and 2s. 6d. per hour afterwards; firemen (each), 4s. for three.hours, and is. per hour afterwards; pumpers at 6d. per hour each. In addition to the above, payment will be required from those employing the Brigade for all damage done to the engine, hose, buckets, or other appliances used with the engine. s.—The engine and firemen may be employed in cases of fire beyond the limits of the borough, and the owners of the property on fire shall pay the Town Council for the same according to the foregoing scale. The Drain Se age heme.—The following report of the special committee was presented :—"" Your committee have had under their consideration the grave legal difficulties which stand in the way of carrying out the wishes of the Council and Mr. Brymer in regard to the Puddletown Heath drainage scheme, and have obtained the advice of counsel upon them. The Council regret to say that the opinion they have thus obtained is to the effect that unless Mr. Brymer is disposed to sell sufficient land to the Corporation for the purpose of a sewage farm or the powers of a local Act of Parliament are obtained, the proposed scheme is not feasible on account of the limited powers of sewage disposal given by the Public Health Act, 1875, and the limited ownership of Mr. Brymer in the land to be dealt with. The opinion of counsel has been, however, handed to Mr. Brymer, who has promised to consult his solicitor upon the subject, and to communicate with the Council again in a few days. It should perhaps be added that Mr. Brymer has expressed his disinclination to sell any portion of the heath in question to the Corporation, though if he were empowered to do so, he would be quite willing to grant a long lease of sufficient land for the purposes in view provided that the supply of sewage could be guaranteed by the Corporation for the same period.""—A letter from Mr. Brymer was also read, in which that gentleman said be would consult his solicitor immediately.—This concluded the business. _ ihestral "

ANNUAL MEETING.  On Tuesday evening the annual public meeting of the Brighouse Branch of the above society took place in the Town Hall, at which there was an exceedingly good attendance. Mr. S. H. BYRNE, the president, occupied the chair, and he was supported On the platform by the following gentlemen—Rev. W. G. Petherick. rector of St. Bartholomew's, Manchester; Rev. G. Oldacres, vicar of Illingworth ; Rev. W. J. Brookes, Halifax; Rev. B. Wilson, Battyeford ; Rev. C. M. Hesilrige. Clifton; and Messrs. A. D. Brunton. R. Woodhouse, and J. Broughton. The meeting was commenced by the singing of the hymn beginning with the words ""What has brought us here together ? "" whin& was followed by prayer by the Rev. G, Oldacres. The Chairman read letters of apology for nonattendance from Mr. Geo. J. Armytage, Clifton Woodhead ; Rev. T. King. vicar of Hartshead ; Rev. J. Trower, curate of Halifax Parish Church ; and Rev. Mr. Holmes, All Souls, Halifax; Mr. Byrne also received a kind letter from the Rev. R. 0-. Irving. incumbent of Rastrick, who was unable to be present, but who heartily sympathises with the movement, intimating that he intends shortly to form a branch of the Church of England Temper.. ance Society at Rastrick. Mr. RICHARD WOODHOUSE, secretary, read the report, as follows—  The Committee in presenting this, the Third Annual Report of the Brighouse Branch of the Church of England Temperance Society, would draw the attention of the members to the fact, that although progress has been made this year it has not been at the rate they had pleasure to report last year. This may be owing, in a great measure, to the loss of our energetic president, who did so much to further the progress of the Society; but fearing it may also be due in some measure to want of earnestness on the part of the members, your committee press upon you all to redouble your energies during the ensuing year, in furthering the objects and promoting the progress of the Society. The total number of members now on the books is 177, of whom 108 are total abstainers and 69 non-abstainers. Since last year 25 new members have been enrolled and 20 members have left; of these 9 have left Brighouse and 11 have broken their pledges. The attendance and interest at the ordinary monthly meetings have been well maintained, the average attendance during the year, at each meeting, being about 90 in the summer months and 110 in the winter months. Our thanks are due to the Revs. G. Oldacres, C. Edwards, H. M. Holden, J. Trower, W. J. Brookes, and Mr. S. Atkinson, for their interesting addresses. Your Committee would here note that they are aware that many members rarely, if ever, attend these meetings, and would desire such to make it a point of duty to endeavour to attend as often as possible, as such attendance will promote the welfare of the Society, and strengthen themselves in the cause. Our Annual Public Meeting. held in the Town Hall on the 19th of March last year, was well attended, and ably addressed by the Rev. J. Ingham Brooke. rector of Thornhill, and Rural Dean: and the Rev. 0. Cookson, Chaplain of Her Majesty's Prison, Leeds. To these gentlemen we tender our grateful thanks. Most of the members will have pleasurable recollections of our Festival Service, held in the Parish Church, Sept. 22rd, last year, when the Rev. Dr. Rice, of Bradford, preached, and the Revs. W. Booker, G. Oldacres, and R. G Irving read the prayers and lessons, and the musical part of the service was well rendered by the united choirs of the Parish and St. James's Churches. The net proceeds of the collection, amounting to £6 15s. Od., were handed over to the Diocesan Society. A petition to the House of Commons, signed by most of our members and others in favour of the total closing of public-houses on Sundays, was presented by Sir M. Wilson, Bart., M.P. _ _ _  The total receipts during the year have been £.26 4s. 3d., and the expenditure £32 ss. 3d„ showing a balance dne to the treasurer of 1,6 Is. 04—not a satisfactory state of things. Most of this expenditure is for temperance literature for distribution among members and others. As there are many people in the neighbourhood who wish the cause of sobriety God speed, but who object to join any society, the Committee think such might be solicited to assist in furthering so laudable an object by contributing to the funds of the Society.  It is with sincere pleasure and satisfaction that we are now able to report the formation of a Juvenile Branch, or Band of Hope. One of the rtles of the Society, as established in 1877, states that"" A band of hope shall be worked In connection with the Society, "" but hitherto the way had not been clearly seen to establish one. On the 24th of January last an inaugural meeting was held in the National Sthool, when the Rev. J. Trower, of Halifax, attended with about 20 children of the Halifax Parish Church Band of Hope. The meeting was addressed by the Rev. J. Trower, and Messrs. S. H. Byrne and J. Broughton, and enlivened by recitations and dialogues by the children, and with glees by the Brighouse Parish Church Choir. The result of the meeting was the enrolment of 140 children. On Tuesday the 17th February, the first monthly meeting was held, at which 14 names were added. A separate Committee—on which are several ladies—has been formed, and there seems to be every probability of having a very successful branch of Juvenile abstainers and a most valuable adjunct to the Adult Section. The CHAIRMAN said the balance-sheet referred to in the report was not favourable, as the secretary had said, and he thought they should have made an effort before this to put it on the right side. Their society had hitherto had a clergyman to preside over the annual meeting, besides the presence of clergymen also on the platform, but still he thought that a layman might say what good their society was doing in the neighbourhood (hear, hear). In this town there were sad cases of drunkenness. It was pitiable to look upon young people and men and women who were victims to this evil. Their society was not a political society. Now many societies were looked at politically and they had to complain against a disease which had been growing during many Parliaments, and the British public would have to go on and create that ""public opinion"" which they were told could alone alter things. The Church of England Temperance Society consisted not only of total abstainers, but also of those who were endeavouring to do something for the suppression of the vice of drunkenness. The requisition to the chairman of the Local Board asking him to call a public meeting for the establishment of a cocoa house in the town indica ted that the public were desirous of having something to stem the flood of intemperance. He wished also to refer to Sunday Closing, and when he told them that three times as many people in Brighouse signed the petition in favour of it as those who were against it and neutral, they would again agree that the people were in favour of something to suppress intemperance. When public houses were established they were quite right, and in the respect as a place for baiting during the old mode of locomotion they did a right work. He urged them to try to inculcate on the youths and young women habits of temperance and thus raise them in the social scale. He wanted to see the time when a man's greatest happiness would not consist in' getting a friend to pay for quarts or gallons of ale. He had seen places where it was not done, and he did not see why it shoqld uot be done here. • It was pitiable indeed to see a big powerful man enter the public house to spend.his last 6d. or 3d. He wanted to see the time when the people would be well clothed and well homed in roomy houses (applause). The Rev. G.'OLDACRES (who was received with  loud cheers) said it was a pleasure to him to be there that night that he might give thern an encouraging word. He did not think it was any matter of regret that they had only a slight increase during the year, neither did he think that a Brighouse audience would allow the slight deficit to remain against the sopiety. He considered that they had accomplished something during the year which they might congratulate themselves on, and that was the establishment of a juvenile branch, and it was a matter also of congratulation that they had enrolled 140 children with the full consent of their parents. He had heard that evening that they now had 170 members in the branch. They were assured of something like sobriety in the future by the abstinence of the children. If there were any consciencious people there he doubted not that they might conscientiously join their society. He considered that the whole matter was contained in one of the verses they had sung that evening—  We are met to help each other Forward in a noble race We have need of one another, Hand in hand, and face to face.  He urged them to come forward and help in the work, and they would have influence in inducing others to come who now held aloof. He moved that the report be adopted, printed, and circulated. He had heard people say—and that quite recently—that they were sick of hearing about temperance; he had replied—"" Yes and we are sick of intemperance"" (hear, hear, and loud applause).  Mr. 'WILLIAM BROOKE, J.P., Honley, in seconding tho proposition, said he had come that evening more to take a leaf from their book than to give-them advice. He would tell them without any flattery that he went away from one of the meetings convinced that they were carrying on their work on a thorough Christian principle. They heard the publicans, who were such a mighty power in the land— but he did not wish to tread on their toes—and the brewers say that their business was being meddled with. They were told that they were very intemperate advocates of temperance; they were told they were trying to rob the poor man of his beer, and that they were interfering with a man's liberty. They were called fanatics. He should like those people who called them fanatics to see some of the sights he saw. He would like those people to go with him and visit a person he knew who was dying of a galloping consumption through drink. Let those who called them fanatics come with him to the magistrates' office and see the young men brought there who a few years before were innocent at their mothers' knees. And let them see a thinly. clad, sickly-looking young woman with a babe at her breast waiting outside tile dock for a hardened young man who was there for drunkenness • and let them see the poor wife manage to scrape together the 18s. 6d. he had been fined. Was that 'fanaticism? This was a case he had noted himself only last week. What should they do, and what could they do to remedy this evil He must say that the time must soon come when public opinion must have some weight in the Licensing Laws of this land, though it was a difficult point to deal with. It was their duty—whatever be their polities—to educate that public opinion. They might reasonably expect, too, some alterations with regard to Sunday Closing (heat., hear, and applause) and the grocers' licenses. He thought there should be some means of gradually reducing the publichouses, but this would require an alteration in the law, as under the existing regulations the landlord of a house could simply keep changing his tenant in a disreputable house and he complied with the law and no one could close the house. He knew that many publicans favoured Sunday Closing. It was, however, a satisfactory thing for them to have counteracting influences—• and he was pleased to observe they had a flourishing cocoa-house at Brighouse—but the best counteracting influence he knew was a comfortable and happy home. It was also somewhat satisfactory to learn that the Excise revenue had fallen short of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's estimate by £1,500,000. That encouraged them in their work. In referring to his personal experience as a teetotaller Mr. Brooke said he believed he had been better during the past four years as a total abstainer than he previously had been. It would not do their health any harm. As to the poor drunkard let them.speak kindly for him. Some of them knew little of the terrible temptations some men had to go through. Let the young men present band themselves together to help forward their cause. His opinion of magistrates at the present day was that public opinion was telling its tale. But whether they were magistrates or not they had all a work to do, and let them do it for Christ's sake (loud applause). The Chairman put the motion to the meeting and it was approved.  The Rev. BENJAMIN WILSON, Battyeford. moved ""That this meeting, while acknowledging with thankfulness the success that has attended the past labours of the Church of England Temperance Society throughout the country, realises the need of renewed effort in the future, and pledges itself earnestly to support the society as a valuable organisation for the suppression of the sin of intemperance and the promotion of true temperance."" He would wish also to remark that he should like to see all the clergy, from the bishops downwards, total abstainers.  The Rev. G. W. PETHERICIC seconded the motion, and remarked that he was present at the first meeting of the Church of England Temperance Society, and he was one of the first secretaries chosen. Its success had been quite remarkable. They now had four bishops among their number, and they all agreed that they could do more work than they could when they were moderators. It was even becoming fashionable to be teetotal—it had reached even royalty itself, as the Princess Louise was in their ranks (applause). Canon Wilberforce joined them as a moderator and was now in the front ranks. Canon Farrar also joined as a moderator, and was now a staunch member. If they were to raise the fallen by help. it was a grand reason for them to be teetotallers. He wished that every man and woman in that room would join them that night. They were doing a good thing by having branches in every village. Drunkenness was a bane; it kept people from the church and it ruined homes. He was very pleased to see some boys and girls present, and he was glad to hear that they had got a juvenile branch in their midst. He had been a teetotaller 25 years, an anecdote related by Mr. Gough had been the means of his taking to total abstinence. _  The motion was put- to the meeting and heartily approved. A vote of thanks to the speakers was warmly accorded on the motion of Mr. JOHN BROUGHTON, seconded by the Rev. W. J. BROOKES, Halifax.  A similar compliment was paid the Chairman on the motion of Mr. Wm. BRooKs, seconded by the Rev. G. OLDACRES.  The concluding hymn—"" On our way rejoicing"" was then sung, after which the Rev. Mr. OLDICRES pronounced the benediction.  WAKEFIELD CATTLE MARKET.—Wednesday. There were 1500 fat beasts on offer this morning, or ten more than last week. A large proportion of the stock consisted of North country animals in prime condition, also five pens of choice Lincolnshire beasts, ten pens of Irish cattle, and six pens of foreign stock. Some of the Irish and foreign animals were not in very good condition. There was a large attendance of buyers. The beef trade ruled brisk at fully last week's prices, and in some instances dealers obtained a slight advance on last Wednesday's quotations. The best beef sold at from 80. to 80., secondary qualities Bd., and rough beasts made about 70. per lb. There were 4600 sheep on offer, and although this number far exceeded the supply at the two previous markets, prices had an upward tendency, and a buyer stated that he had not known mutton so dear for the past seven years. The same gentleman also stated that the supply of sheep in this country at the present time is very light, and he firmly predicted that the unusually high prices now current will be maintained for some time to come. Sheep in wool sold at from 9d. to mid. per pound, and in some cases dealers obtained 104 d. There was a large number of clipped or shorn sheep, which sold at from 70. to 80. per pound. A few very fine south country lambs were on offer, and they changed hands at unusually high prices. Six hundred and fifty pigs were penned, and trade in this department was much brisker than for a long time past, at the follbwing quotations :—Small pigs, 20s. to 265. each; strong stores, 50s. to 60s. each; and fat pigs, 7s. to Bs. per stone.

RAILWAY RATES AND CHAUGES. On the second reading of the first zeries of nine Railway Rates and Charges Provisional Order Bills, Mr. P. Stanhope moved an amendment declining to proceed with the consideration of a scheme for the revision of railway rates which was based upon the full recognition of the legality of station terminal charges, with respect to which the Standing Committee on Trade expressly refrained from formu lating any opinion. Mr. Winterbotham seconded the aim ndment, especially complaining of the burden which the new rates would impose upon agriculturists. Sir M. Hicks Bt'ach, who warmly eulogised the patience and ability displayed by Lord Balfour of Burleigh and Mr. Courtenay Boyle, in the prolonged inquiry which they had conducted, pointed out that the Board of Trade had considerably increased the obligations and limited the maximum rates of the railway companies, and that if any ground for complaint still existed it would be considered by :he joint committee to which he proposed to refer the various bills. With regard to station terminals, they were already charged by the railway companies, and as the condition of their being recognised by the Board of Trade he had considerably reduced the maximum conveyance rates. He asked the House, in the interests of traders and agriculturists. as well as of the railway companies, to proceed with these bills in order that the question might be definitely settled by the present Parliament. The debate was continued by Mr. M‘Laren, Mr. Barclay, Sir R. Paget, Mr. Chaplin, and others; and eventually, Sir M. Hicks Beach *having hit imated that the opposition to various proposals in the bills could be resumed when the joint I ommittee had reported,the amendment was withdrawn and the bills were read a second time, at,d ordered to be referred to a. joint committee of both Houses. Hump. RULE ALL ROUND. Dr. Clark, on the order for Supply, moved a resolution in favour of devolving upon the representatives of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales respectively the management and control of their domestic affairs. Mr. S. Evans having seconded the motion, Mr. Somervell was speaking against it when the House was counted out. "

An interesting trial of a new stenographic raachine has been made in the French Chamber in the presence of M. Gambetta and a number of other officials and members. The mechanism, which is an Italian invention, is worked by a kind of keyboard similar to that of a small piano, and the stenographic signs, not unlike those used in the ordinary French shorthand, are automatically printed on a continuous ribbon of paper. The signs registered of course represent sounds, irrespective of spelling, and the machine can be used by a person unacquainted with the language spoken. The daughter of the inventor worked the machine successfully, taking down a speech read at the average speed in Italian, and one read in French by M. Gambetta, she being ignorant of the latter language. A comparison between the speed of the machine and that of the shorthand writers of the Chamber proved favourable to the former. Further experiments will be made with a view to a possible adoption of the apparatus, which iaialready in use in the Italian Chambers. "

It was a most formal document, merely alluding to the change of Government brought about by the verdict of the country on Home Rule, and urging Parliament to use expedition in completing the Supplies for the year. The after-proceedings were, however. some what more important. In the House of Lords, Earl Granville, and in the Commons Mr. Gladstone, asked for a statement of the views of the Government, especially upon the subject of Ireland. Both statesmen pointed out that, although strong demands had been made upon the late Government by the present Ministry for repressive measures, they themselves did not now propose anything of the kind. Mr. Gladstone especiall% noted this as a gratifying feature of the situation. He also alluded to the grave doubts -xpressed as to the ability of the Irish farmers to pay rents during the coming winter, and expressed the opinion that Parliaemnt and the country ought not to be left till next January or February without any explanation being given of the course which the Government proposed to take. In reply, Lord Salisbury and Lord R. Churchill announced that it was proposed to despatch Sir Redvers Buller to the south and west of Ireland, where outrage most prevails, armed with absolute control over the police and military, and with full powers to reduce the district to order. With reference to rents and other questions relating to the land, a Royal Commission is to conduct an inquiry during the winter, but the Government will enforce rents. A smaller Co-- mission is also to consider the feasibility of developing the resources of the country. Both Ministers concluded their speeches with a declaration that they regarded the decision of the constituencies to uphold the Union as irrevocable. In the Lords, the Address in reply to the Queen's Speech was adopted. In the Commons, Lord R. Churchill's announcements drew protests from one after another of the Irish members, and the debate had to be adjourned. Previous to thedebate on the Address Lord Rando!ph announced that the Government would demand the full time of the House for the purposes of Supply. On the renewal of the Standing Orders, Mr. Bradlaugh took a division against the rule forbidding Peers to take part in elections, but was opposed by Mr. Gladstone, and his amendment was rejected by a large majority.

The British and African Steam Navigation Corn. pany's steamer Loanda, which has arrived in the Mersey from t.le West Coat of Africa, brings particulars of the capture of Tambi. When the news was first received at Freetown of the reverse to the British arms then was naturally much excitement in the settlement. The avenging force consisted of about 550 of the 2nd West India Regiment, under Colonel Ellis, about 150 Frontier Police, and about 400 Friendlies. The Frier.dlies were led by Captain Lendy, an English officer, and, together with the police, were told off to attack the northern part of the stockade. The West India Regiment had the most difficult task, and commenced the attack. Altogether the force had with them one or two Maxim guns, two seven-pounders, and a number of rockets. The enemy at first appeared to be very numerous inside the stockade, and returned the fire in a very brisk manner. In about an hour the reply became less vigorous. The attacking forces continued to advance against the stronghold. The Friendlies on the north side were also very busy, but the force of the defenders was mainly centred on the West India men. Lieutenant Boileau, R.E., was the first to lead his men into the stockade, and in a few moments the West India troops rushed the South Gate and also entered the stronghold. It was then seen that the structure was a most forniidable one, chiefly built of extremely hard wood, each piece about a foot in thickness. The stockade wan circular in shape, and inside were two walls of wood, as well as here and there entrenchments to assist the defenders. The enemy fought with much spirit, but when they became aware of the flank movement of the police and the Friendlies, which threatened to cut off all possibility of retreat, most of them left the stockade and forded the liver, leaving but a couple of hundred men inside the stronghold. When the latter saw the rapid approach of the English force the majority of them also beat a retreat in the same direction. Many of their comrades had fallen in defending the place, and when the British troops entered they were confronted by numbers of corpses lying at their posts. The attention of the victors was then directed to the fugitives, many of whom were fording the river in their flight, and in this position formed targets for the British rifles. It was estimated that close on a hundred of the enemy were killed either in the stockade or by being shot in the river while attempting to escape. On the British side two of the West India Regiment received mortal wounds, and several others were shot, but their injuries were not serious. The steckade was razed to the ground, and then the Friendlies, whose enthusiasm was most exuberantly manifested, scoured the country in every direction in pursuit of the enemy. They captured a number of women and children, and these, it is said, they were allowed to keep as their prizes or slaves. The wounded, with one exception, were brought down to Sierra Leone, as the man's condition was too serious to admit of his removal. The other man, who was so badly injured, died in the hospital at Sierra Leone, a short time after his admission. The officers, who were all white, led their men in a most gallant fashion. Colonel Ellis, of the West India Regiment, directed the operations in person. Two of the Royal Engineers blew up the gate with guncotton right in the teeth of the enemy. Their action was most brave, and after the explosion one of them was struck and seriously wounded by ' a huge splinter.  THEFT BY A PARCEL-POST GUARD.  At Bow-street, on Friday, Thomas Embleton was charged with stealing a florin, the property of the Postmaster General.—Prisoner was guard of the Parcels Post van running between London and Oxford. In consequence of complaints a test parcel was made up on Wednesday night. It contai-i;d, among other things, some marked money. When the parcel was delivered to the gentleman to whom it was at:dressed at Oxford, it was found that during its transit a marked florin had been abstracted. It was afterwards ascertained that tiscner had changed this coin at a butcher's shop It Oxford. When spoken to he admitted his guile. isoner was committed for trial.  7 THE ANARCHIST TRIAL. At the Central Criminal Court, on Friday, the trial of David John Nicoll and Charles Wilfred Mewbrav, for inciting and encouraging persons to murder the Home Secretary, Mr. Justice Hawkins, and Inspector Melville, was commenced. The Attorney-General, Mr. Fulton, Q.C., and Mr. Horace Avery, prosecuted; and Mr. J. P. Grain and Mr. Burnie defended Mowbray. In the article complained of, which appeared in the Commonweal of April 9th, the Home Secretary was described as a Jesuitical monster who murdered men for taking a few head of game, while Mr. Justice Hawkins was said to be a hyena who I rreyed upon bodies of hanged men, and he was also called a barbarous brute. The article went on, ""shoot us down as you did the strikers at Fourmies, and then be surprised if your houses are shattered with dynamite, and if the people shrink from the companionship of officials of the law as 'dangerous company.'"" ""Justice has been done,"" it proceeded. ""Has it, gentlemen of the middle classes i' "" Then It went on, ""Justice! It may be! Perhaps, too, it will be just when the oppressed strike back at you without ruth and mercy; only don't whine for pity in these days, for it will be useless."" Nicoll was further indicted for inciting persons to murder other persons unknown. The defendants pleaded not guilty. The Attorney-General, in opening the case for the prosecution, said that he was not instructed as to whether the prisoners carried on any trade or handicraft,apart from their connection with a paper called the Commonweal. Nicoll, however, was the registered proprietor of the paper,and Mowbray was the publisher. The facts were very simple; but it was necessary for him to go back to dates prior to the 9th April. They had nothing to do with the political opinions of the prisoners. The jury would remember the Anarchist trials at Walsall. The men there were found in possession of diabolical instruments, and they were convicted. In this paper these men were they up as brave fellows, and as worthy of general approbation. Counsel quoted a number of the articles, and said the paper hasl 11 preached doctrines which any right-thinking mll who had any respect for law and order must repr ' bate as being in the highest degree wicked an dangerous. There were also directions amply sufficient to enable persons to provide and preparb explosives and bombs if they desired to use them. , It might be said that the article was written in a . moment of indignation, but this would not apply to the speech of which complaint was made,and which was spoken in Hyde Park on the 10th of April. Evidence was then given as to the publication ot the paper, and also that in the issue of the 16th of April the name of Mowbray had disappeared as the publisher, and that of Nicoll had been substituted. Detective Sweeney deposed to Nicoll being a regular attendant at meetings of anarchists held in South-place and other localities. He (the witness) was present at the Hyde Park meeting on the 10th • of April, when Nicoll spoke of Mr. Justice Hawkins as ""Butcher Hawkins,"" and urged his comrades to 1 strike back. The witness was present at the trial I of the Walsall Anarchists.  Police-constable Robert Powell gave corroborative evidence. He heard Nicoll allude to Mr. Justice Hawkins as ""Hangman Hawkins."" Evidence of arrest having been given, Nicoll said: My lord, I should like to say that while 1 was in the cell a gentleman came to me, and asked me if I would care to write to my friends. He sympathised with me, and I did write, my lord; that letter was never delivered, but is used in evidence against me to-day. A statement made by Nicoll at the police-court was here put in. He admitted writing the article, but did not mean to incite anyone to crime. He wrote under strong feeling, and in similar circumstances would do so again. A portion of an article written by Nicoll, but not printed, was also handed in. The writer said, ""If they were to receive six months' imprisonment for stating that Hawkins and Matthews were unfit to live they must endure it, but if all poisons who thought so were to be treated similarly it would be a long job, for that name was legion."" Mr. Grain addressed the court on behad 011 Mowbray, and the Attorney-General replied. The Lord Chief Justice summed up, and the Jury returned a verdict of guilty against Nicoll on two counts, and found Mowbray not guilty. His lordship, a Idressing Nicoll, said he had, during the trial, conducted himself well, and had sliewn considerable education and force of character. But he had been guilty of a very grievous offence indeed. Suppose any h)t-headed persons had taken the advice that was given in the articles,they would have been morally guilty of murder. It was possible that Nicoll acted in hot blood, without considering the very grave consequences of what he wrote. He hoped the prisoner would believe that what he had said about the mistake and folly of his conduct was sincere. If he desired to amend things he was going the wrong way about it. He was setting all right-thinking men against him, makint them harsh instead of favourable judges, and turning away sympathy from what might justly be regarded as wrongs. For the sake of the law, and that others should not be encouraged to think they could do these things with impunity, he must pass a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment, with hard labour. Nicoll wa3 then removed to the cells, and Mowbray was liberated. "

The Local Government Board state, inter ails, in this respect:—"" The practice of giving indiscriminate and unconditional outdoor relief has been generally condemned. Upon the Guardians devolves the arduous and responsible duty of exercising a wise discrimination in eat-ti case which conies before them so as to ensure that any relief which they may decide to grant shall be subject to such conditione as will check the supply of future , pauperitem When outdoor relief is given it should , he carefully adapted to the needs of the case and adequate in amount. It is the plain duty of the Guardians to take precautions to ensure that the relief is adequate. and that the pauper is sufficiently fed, clothed, and lodged. There should also be a close and careful supervision of all eases in which outdoor relief is granted. It is desirable that there should be a close co-operation between the Guardians' officers and the officers of the Sanitary Authority."" The committee are of opinion that practical effect should be given to these opinions of the !steal Government Board and recommend ac cordingly : (1) More Frequent Revision of Castes—That outdoor relief cases be revised more frequent.y, and, in particular, the whole of the outdoor relief ewe', be reviserl each quarter instead of halfyearly as now and grants made only for 13 weeks in lieu of 26 weeks as at present. At these quarterly revision meetings the committee recommend the members representing other townships serve on the Local Relief Committees. (2) Unsanitary Dwellings.—The committee heartily approvee the suggestion of the Local Government Board that the Guardians and the Sanitary Authorities should work in co-operation, and that, to this end, the Relieving Officers and I.ady Visitor lx: instructed to report to the Clerk any 011. of unsanitary dwellings inhabited by peoons in receipt of outdoor mile( and that the Clerk then communicate forthwith with the Sanitary Authorities. RELIEF COMMITTEES. Committees.—The Local Government Board recommend in the circular that, in order that a certain measure of uniformity of action may be attained in the grunting of outdoor relief, the Relief Committees leaking such grants shall be so constituted as to represent the Union as a whole and not be composed solely of members from thel same township. , As to this, the committee observe that the Guardians on April 14th, 1910, having decided, by 17 votes to 4, that they could not accept this principle, and, having decided that the longestablished practics of this Union be adhered to, i.e., the Relief Committees of each township to be composed of the numbers repressnting that township, they feel precluded from dealing further with this matter, beyond drawing attention to the further resolution adopted by the Guardians on that occasion, vir.: That members of Relief Committees shall not adjudicate on applications for relief made by persons hailing from the ward such members represent."" Attention is drawn to the recomnrendation already made that other than township members be appointed to serve on the Relief Committees when the quarterly revision meetings are being held. Relieving Officers.—ln this connection the circular sets forth: "" For the efficient administration of outdoor relief it is of the utmost importance that there should be a sufficient staff of relieving officers: that they should be properly qualified for their duties, and should have time to investigate fully and periodically the cases under their charge."" It is further pointed out that in scene Unions the appointments of (1) superintendent relieving officer, (2) general relieving officer, (3) cross visitor, (t) assistant relieving officer, (5) women relieving office:s have been made with satisfactory results. As to the first four of these appointments, the committee feel that the size of the Union does not warrant any such appointment in this Union. With respect to the appointment of women re lieving officers, the committee observe that, as the Guardians know, a lady visitor is now appointed, and amongst her prescribed duties are the visiting and reporting upon outdoor relief cases involving children, widows and old persons. In this respect, therefore, the requiremeets of the circular have already been met by the Guardians. The COII 111 l ittee gave considerable attention to the strong recommendation of the Local Government Board that outdoor relief should be paid at the homes of the recipients, but decided to petition° a definite recommendation in the matter until the question of pay stations was reached. Further in this connection, they considered an application made by Mr. T. Holt, relieving officer. Rawtenstall, asking for further assistance in his district—referred to this conunittee by the Board on Wednesday, April 6th, 1910, but they decided that a decision in the matter should be postponed until the lady visitor had thoroughly entered upon her duties and until the effect of this circular as a whole had been felt. CASE PAPER SYSTEM. The circular states:— Experience has shown that one of the most useful means of enabling Guardians to ascertain and co-ordinate the circumstances and the needs of applicants for relief is what is known as the case paper syatem."" "" The advantages to be derived from the useof the case paper systent are obvious. It is the best !scans of securing that the Guardians have all the necessary information relating to an applicant. 6Pb:ire deciding on his case. When the ease next comes up for further consideration, Me system ensures that the detailed information will be before the Guardians, thus enabling them to deal with the case on consistent lines."" "" The Board propose at an early date to make the keeping of case papers compulsory: but they hope that in many Unions it will be practicable to start the system forthwith."" The committee carefully considered these recomtnendations and recommended the Board:— (1) To authorise a deputation to visit other Unions to enquire into the working of the case paper system. (2) That the Clerk obtain copies of a book on the ""Case paper system"" for every member. The Board approved both recommendations and every member was in due course supplied with the book in question so that the comtnittee consider that they niay conclude that every member is familiar with the pros and cons of the system. Moreover, several members of the committee end Board have seen the system in actual operation in Ecsdesall Bierlow Union (Sheffield), where it has been established six years, and in Chorlton Union (Manchester). where it has been in opera• lion nearly two years. The committee now recommend that the Clerk Ire directed to establish the system forthwith. The committee recognise from the outset that the system, especially at the initial stages, is both sotnewhat costly and involves much additional labour, but they feel that the ultimate benefits of the system quite outweigh these considerations. They recommend that the Clerk be requested to frame a complete set of case papers applicabls to this Union; that the necessary filing cabinets be obtained, and that the Clerk be authorised to engage the necessary staff to institute and carry out the system. The C:erk is of opinion that if he were allowed: (1) An extra permanent junior assistant clerk to be appointed at 10s. per week, rising by annual incrementa of 2s. fal. to a maximum of £1 se r 1 week: and (2) to engage a temporary clerk for one year or 18 months at 255. to 30s. per wee]: : he could institute the system within 12 or 13 . months, and in that time have compiled a "" Hi, "

For a large prsrtion of the strikers the question is not whether they will work on these terms or on those, but whether they will draw strike pay and do nothing. or do nothing and draw no pay at all. It Is their interest to prolong the strike by the free use of intimidation and violence if necessary, or even by preference, and that is exactly what they are doing. It is notorious that many members ot the Union would be glad enough ta go back to work if they dared. An organisation which can be used for such • purpose as this has ceased to be a legitimate Union for the mutual help and protection of workmen, and has become a piece of machinery for the purpose of promoting mob violence—that is to say, a disorderly pest.

The death Is announced of Sir Thomas Henry, thief magistrate at Bow street. It occurred suddenly at his house in Hanover square, on the evening of June With. Sir Thomas had been at Ascot during the week, discharging his magisterial duties at the police-station connected with the racecourse, as had been his custom for many years. He had been suffering from a slight cold for some time, but on the above date he seemed more seriously affected. He was urged to go home, and consented. He left Ascot at three o'clock, accompanied by Sergeant Butcher, and on arriving at his house late in the afternoon he felt better. Inn few minutes, however, he became much worse, and he expired without pain at five o'clock. Dr. Quain was sent for, but, owing to the shortness of the notice, did not arrive until a few minutes after death had occurred. Sir Thomas Henry was born in Dublin in 1807, and was educated at Trinity College, where he graduated as Master of Arts. He was called to the English Bar at the Middle Temple in 1829, and was appointed magistrate at Lambeth Police•eourt in 1840, and thence transferred to Marlborough street. On the retirement of Mr. T. J. Hall, in 1864, he was appointed chief magistrate at Bow street. Before taking his seat he received the honour of knighthood, which has been offered to every chief magistrate there since the creation of the office, and has only been declined by two—Mr. Read and Mr. Hall.  ..., rep-resent the crime as a political one.

Now, really, is this the way a member of an important body like the School Board should be chosen ? It was nothing more or less throughout than a juggle for power. We have nothing to say against Mr. Tillotson Wilkinson; he may make a very good member. He is not, we believe, known to a very large section of the public, or if he is then we are not included in that section. But that is not the point. The impossibility of a real representative member being secured by co-option no matter how the juggle may have turned is apparint ; and we have in this instance a foreta,te of what is to come if the Government's Education Bill gets through. The people, if they want to be properly represented, mmt be represented directly, and it would have been better had the School Board emphasised its already expressed disapproval of at least parts of the Bill for it is but a resurrection of last year's atrocity after all —by deciding that the vacancy should be properly filled by the ratepayers and not by a couple of members, of the Board. Failing this, in our opinion, , the new member should have been the next on the poll at the last election who at least would have some tanglible body 'of constituents at his back, whereas a gentleman who has not been to the poll has none save in , conjecture—and it is a poor stool.

HISTORY OF THE SEPTENNIAL ACT. Since the passing of the Septennial Act in 1716 there have been 37 general elections. The Parliament now drawing to a close will be the eighth dissolved in the month of June. Of the remainder six expired in March, six in April, six in July, three in September, two in November, two in December, one in January, one in February, one in May, snd one in October. Curious to relate, there has been no dissolution in August du, ing the whole period. The interval between the dissolution and the meeting of the new Parliament in 1727 was 19 weeks, but on no subsequent occasion has it exceeded nine weeks, and since 1852 it has never exceeded six weeks, except in 1885, when seven weeks and six days intervened. The shortest interval on record is four weeks and one day, which °centred in 1868, the average for the last eight Parliaments being five weeks and 41 days. "

The basket was knocked to pieces, and its contents were scattered over the railway for a considerable distance. The postman and 'the barrow were thrown violently aside, but, marvellous to relate, the man, save for a few bruises, was none the worse. The contents of the mail-bags were gathered together, and though many of the letters were much torn they were all duly delivered.

Many boys would be sent to them, he believed, who would otherwise have been sent to the Reformatory School, and if the magistrates would take up the boys likely to fall into crone and send therm to Iffilborne Sihool, they would effect a reformation.

There is no medical preparation which may be so thoroughly relied upon in the treatment of the above ailments as Holloway's Ointment.

The Ointment well rubbed upon the Chest and Back, night and morning, penetrates the skin, and thus absorbed, is carried directiv to the Lungs, where, in immediate contact with the whole mass of circulating Blood, it neutralises or expels all impurities. By these meant all pulmonary complaints may be cured with rapidity and ease. ISORDERS OF THE KIDNEYS, STONE, AND GRAVEL In any of the above complaints more benefit may be derived in twenty-four hours, by adopting the following simple means, than could be brougfit about in six months by any other treatment. In bad cases, if the Ointment be diligently rubbed in the small of the back, over the region of th 3 Kidneys, it will quickly penetrate and give immediate relief. Six or sight of the Pills should be taken nightly according to ciretw)tances. GOUT, RHEUMATISM, AND STIFF JOINTS This invaluable Ointment exercises a more obvious contro over Gout and Rheumatism, than any other Medicine. No one need remain uncured, who will in good e'irtiest, make a vigorous application of this invaluable remedy—according to the Printed Instructions affixed to each Pot. All settled aches and pains will likewise he banidied by the same treatment. SKIN DISEASES, SCROFULA, AND SCURVY.

Druitt, Esq., jun., deputy coroner. Mr. Cr. Fudge was cho•eu freman if the jury, and the body haviog been loved the following evidence wai taken :  William Townson said he was manager to Mr. Brown, fishmonger. He was bathing from the beach this morning, at about a quarter-pa.,t seven, and was coming towards the shore, on the west eke of the pier, just below the boathouses. Just as he got within depth he heard someone cry, ""Help."" lie loeked in the direction from whence the cry proceeded but could see no one, except two men on the bathing raft. Ile was midway between the raft and the shore. Thinking it was the men on the raft who had called, ra a that they were only joking, he came a little further towards the shore, when some one said there Was a man drowning. He immediately swam out, calling out, • Where. ' When he got parallel with the pier stepe at out fifty yards westward, he taeght eight of the bacic of a mate head, with the face downwards. It was about half a dozen yards further out to sea. He struck out as Lard as he could, but when he reached the spot the luau had disappeared. He was a little exhausted, but as soon as he could get his breath he dived about, endeavoui ing to find the body. The water was so thick he cuuld scarcely see his hand under it. Noticing some are putting off from the shore, he put his hand up and remained in the same position. It was nearly ten minutes before any grappling irons or other appliances were obtained. He kept swimming about the spot till about a quarter to eight, but saw nothing of the body till at last it was washed in to shine, nearly in a straight line from where he last saw it die ippear. A man espied it from the pier, and someone walk,dl in from the shore and took it out born the water. There was no sea on, but a heavy ground swell. The tide was flowing in. The swell made the water shallow at one moment and deep at the next. It was not sufficiently powerful to take any one off his feet. though it would take him out of his depth. 'I here was, however, a strong under current. George Sutton, upholsterer, living at 1, Taunton. terrace, said he knew the deveared. He was 25 years of age, and was a stone carver. His home was at Dorchester, but he had been lodging at 22, l'he Trianele. He and deceased were bathing together from the beach that morning. They came down at about seven o'clock, accompanie i by Mr. White and Mr. Hanscombe. Deceased gave him to understand he could swim. Deceased went into the water first, anti witness followed him, but he did not notice whether he swam at all. They had bathed together yesterday (Sunday) morning, but that was the only time. Witness could swim a little, but not much, and never went out of his depth. White, who followed him into the water, swam straight off to the raft. When he last saw the deceased he was standing with the water up to his arm-pits, facing the shore. Witness then threw himself on his back. A little while after he stoed up, and looked round, but could see nothing of Wilson. White and Hanscombe were on the raft. He saw Townson directly he miescel Wilson, and said, ""There's a man gone there."" Tow neon at once swam in the direction indicated, and witness ran to the boathouse t) get a boat out. Some one got a boat out directly, but who it was be could not tell. He helped to launch another boat, and then feeling he could do no further good, he went and put on his clothes. Wilson had been living here for several menthe, but he could not say how long. He was a slam!, healthy man, and he had heard no complaint as to his being unwell. He appeared quite right when ha went into the water. Benjamin R. White said he was one of the party of four who came down to bathe this morning. He walked out as tar as he could towards the raft, and when the water became too deep he turned round and told Hanscombe they would have to swim. He saw Wilson on the top of a breaker. He appeared to jump up as the wave mussed him, lie was some distance nearer the shore than witness, and mare, the pier. On reaching the raft he rested for a short time with Benscombe. He heard nothing of Wilson being missing till he reached the shore. His attention was taken up with Hanscombe, who appeared to be giving out, and asked him if he could ""bottom."" He saw Sutton, and id ,nld tell by his face there wee something the matter. He saw Townson with his had up. When he last saw Wilson he was walking. Witness had bathed with him once before., but could not say whether he o add swim or not; eLceased told them he could. The Sea was calm, except when the great rollers came in. Oscar C. Alootham said he was on the hearth that morning at about half-past seven. He heard that a man was drowned, and came to the club-rooms with another man and got a boat out. That was the third boat. People were seaiching near the steps at the Pier. He beard that the man who was drowned a uld not swim, and told them that in that case they had better look nearer the shore. Ile then saw the body, but before he could reach it someone walked in Iron& the shore and took held of it. 'Witness, however, jumped out of the boat, and heiped to take the body ashore. They laid it n the sands, and eudeavoured to restore animation. Their efforts were unsuccessful, and they then took a board and carried ceceased up to the boat-house, where they made fulther efforts. Dr. Nanktval and Dr. Thompson then came and they also tried to restore life, hut without success. There WAS a smooth sea, will: rolling waves, as WWI very often the case after eturrny weather. It Was not a dangerous stea to bathe in, and the water was warm. By the Jury : He saw no signs of life when the body was taken out. There was no appearance of ClaThp. The Coroner briefly summed up the evi!ence to the jury, who returned a verdict of "" Accidently Drowned."" A juryman expressed the opinion that there should be a beat kept near the bathing station, and at the request of the jury Dr. Druitt pi omised that he would lay the matter before the Commissioners. Mr. Mootham suggested that what was wanted was that there should be a large net which could be run out in cases of this soit ; bad there been such a net on the piesent occasion the body could have been recovered in three minutes—probably in time for animation to have been restorer'.  The jury having thanked Mr. Townson for his gallant efforts to save the deceased, the proceedings terminated. "

Much might be said pro and ton, but if the chairman and the meeting thought otherwise, then it obviously showed bad taste for Mr Orr to set both at defiance. If the ruling of the chair, —when supported by the meeting—is not to be respected, then farewell to the conducive management of public business, unless Thomas is appointed a sergeant of arms to escort defiant hers to the tower of prudence! Without end into the merits of Mr Orr's statement, I do the most praiseworthy course would have been for him to treat the letter with the contempt which it deserved, as such a scene only affords the satisfaction which the writer so ardently hankered after.  We are a long-suffering people, but that is no reason why we should be taken advantage of by chemical work managers who insist on contaminating our atmosphere with those balmy odours of chlorine gas. The mild atmosphere of the past week was most favourable for the inhabitants receiving the full benefit of the quintessences that on Monday enshrouded our town like a fog. As this is a case of habit and repute, it is now high time our civic authorities took action. If I mistake not they are bound to consume somewhere about 90 per cent of the gas but at present they are letting-of the 90; and consuming the 10. A proper representation to head quarters is all that is necessary to terminate this extensive nuisance and maintain the public rights. Very little difficulty need be experienced in bringing the charge home to one work in particular, as the gas may be seen any of these dull days, being emitted in clouds, and I remember at the Ayrshire Rifle meeting in August last, the poor policeman who collected the money at the gate, was nearly suffocated with the fumes which enveloped him, while the buttons of his tunic assumed that black colour so frepuently found on door knobs.  After the lapse of twenty years, I enjoyed once more the privilege of hearing that celebrated lecture of Dr. Robertson's on Martin Luther. Fourteen of these twenty years the Rev. Dr. has been laid aside from pastoral work through ill health, and that no doubt accounts for the length of time that has elapsed since he lectured in Irvine. Still the recollection of the lecture had not been effaced from the memory of those who heard it then, and the prospect of hearing it once more gave them additional pleasure. The story of Luther is well known. Lately it has been told in almost every city, town, and village of our land, but as Dr. Robertson said, there are various ways of telling a story, and certainly the Dr. has a way of his own, a way peculiar to himself. If it so happens that the lecture, as delivered on Thursday last, should be published, it will be read with avidity, and appreciated by the public as a masterpiece of literature, but it will fall far short of what it was as delivered by the lecturer. The elocutionary and dramatic effects will be awanting. It will be like reading Shakespeare at the fireside, compared with Shakespeare as rendered by Henry Irving on the stage. The opening passage's, the thunderstorm, the cuckoo legend, the Diet at Worms, and many other parts of the lecture, were simply masterpieces of eloquence, clothed in the choicest language, and delivered in true dramatic style. Those who had the privilege of listening to that story of Luther will not soon forget it. I have however wondered at the want of appreciation of such a lecture, and such a lecturer, by the public of Irvine, who, instead of embracing an opportunity which thousands would have done if afforded them, showed their apathy and want of interest, by leaving other towns to supply nearly one half of the audience.  SCRUTATOR.  A football match was played on Saturday last, between the Athletic and the Hawthorn, and resulted in favour of the Athletic by 3 goals to none.  The smack Express, of Ayr, bound from Newry to Irvine, with a cargo of scrap iron, for one of the forge works in town ran ashore in Ballygally Bay, on Friday last, and has since become a total wreck.  Ma RI7SHBURY'S CONCERT.--Our readers will observe that Mr Iknshbury. intends paying a visit to Irvine on Thursday first, when he will be supported by one of the best companies that has yet visited our town. .  Huesoex _HIPMENTS. —The shipments at the Harbour, during the week ending 22nd December, are as follows :—lmports, Salt 292 tons, Burnt Ore 219, Limestone 182, Moulding Sand 45, Ballast 43, Exports, Coal 2635, Total, 3416 tons. Guinsrosx CLUB.—On Friday evening, Mr James Stephenson lately officer of the Inland Revenuehere, delivered a lecture on ""Taxation,"" to the members of the Gladstone Club, in which he pointed out the advantages of the new mode of collection. Mr Duncan Gilmour presided. Ttix CARSCOCKLE RAILWAY.—The ceremony of cutting the sod was performed last week, when the engineer, Mr A. B. Smith, lately harbour-master here, presented Lady Jardine with a silver spade, and Miss Jardine with a barrow of polished teak. At the dinner, Mr Maxwell in proposing the health of Mr Smith, expressed himself highly satisfied with the manner in which the work had been done.  LET OF LANDS. —The annual let of lands for pasture and cropping on Ardeer estate took place on Saturday last. Lands for green and white crop brought £8 6s. to a 7s. Gd. ; ploughing lands for one white crop, £lO 25.; grass parks averaged about a per imperial acre. Mr E. Magee, Saltcoats, officiated as auctioneer; and Mr A. C. M`Jannet, factor, Irvine, had charge of the sale.  V HAMEL ASHORE. —The brigantine __Olpah, of Belfast, 112 tons, Burns master, from Kallyleagh, with ballast, went ashore on the North bank close to the bar, while attempting to make the harbour, on Friday morning about six o'clock. The tug at once proceeded to her assistance, but the sea was running too high to allow of anything being done. She has not received any damage, and will be got off with an early tide. THE Scorcu COAL TRADE.—There is little change to report in the state of the coal trade this week. In anticipation of the New-Year holidays the miners have been everywhere closely at work, and masters have thus been enabled to execute ordeni promptly. The shipping department in the past 'week has been fairly active for the season, as will be seen from the following comparative returns :1888.

In the absence of the Hon. G. R. Vernon, chairman of the committee, Mr J.H. Young, Milgarholm, ass_called upon to preside. The chairman said he seas not satisfied as to the fact that the population of &Hecate exceeded 600 ti, and pointed out that the trustees had Interests to be protected in reference to the proposal to take Saltcoats and the assessment accruing therefrom from the district. He moved that the trustees enter an appearance in Court, and protect their interests. Mr Carruthers, Kilwinning, seconded. Dr Brown, Saltcoats, moved as an amendment that the trustees take no action in reference to the petition of the householders of Saltcoats, but reserve their rights. He said that there would be sufficient opposition from other sources without the trustees spending public money in this way. Mr Aiwort,on, Saltcoats, seconded. On a divismon the eaneßkattat N 5 cfrxieti by eve vp.t. VkAnir  •;144.14  Dundonald, 21st December, 1883 SIR,—In your report of Dundonald School Board Meeting, held on the 13th inst. you do not report the reasons I gave in support of motion, regarding a revisal of the Teachers' Salaries. Consequently I have made out a report of what I then said and trust that you will be good enough to insert it in your next issue. ""In proposing this motion it will be necessary to go back to the action of the School Board elected in 1876. for a precedent, that Board being of opinion the Teachers' Salaries were too high, reduced the whole of the Head Masters' Salaries, and I have no doubt as ghey thought in accordance with their respective duties and responsibilities viz ; MM. Max. Portland School, £230. £250 and free house. Fullerton „ £2OO. £2OO & £l5 for house Dundonald £2lO. £230 & £2O for house.  The salaries all .emiiii-ed at that rate -tin@ the first vacancy in Dundonald when the salary was reduced to £l5O min. and £lBO max. with £2O for a House, and again this year Dundouald Teachers' Salary has been reduced to £l3O min. .4160 max. including £2O for a house. This state of matters seems to me most inconsistent seeing they are Elementary Schools and the Teachers requiring the same training and qualififations to perform their duties efficienty, without regard to the number of pupils, as a large school has a corresponding staff of teachers in accordance with the numbers of pupils, consequently there cannot be much difference in the actual work of the head masters in a large school, by a smaller one, and seeing the same qualifications are required, it is surely unfair to teachers and ratepayers alike that there should be so much distinction of the salaries of the teachers under the same Board. As the Committee, who were appointed last year, reported that the Salaries paid by this Board were 420 per cent. hi*her than :those paid by other Boards in the area m which their enquiries extended, they recommended that this !fact be noted by the Board, and a reduction made:in the first change that took place in the appointments. Now I have no desire to reduce the salaries so low, that the teachers would be likely offered more elsewhere, or in any way lower the efficiency in the teaching, but I think if the Board can be justified in reducing the salary of a teacher in one corner of the pariah, I see no reason why it should not apply to the others at the same time.""

Mr DiJkie did me the honour last night to ask me to pmside on this public occasion, I felt it to be both a duty and a pleasure, affording at the seine time an opportunity of testifying to the high regard and esteem in which Dr Robertson is held. Fortunately no words that I could employ are necessary to commend Dr Robertson in his own church, and in the audience of his own attached, congregation, and many friends beside, to bespeak for him your kind attention to the lecture he so frankly consented to deliver upon a subject specially interesting and instructive, and which the reverend lecturer is so eminently qualified to handle. May I venture in his presence to express the gratilication we all share in to see Dr Robertson again amongst his Irvine friends so hearty and so well, and having so much of the dew of his youth about him, and upon his own platform, wherefrom Dr Robertson has so frequently spoken words of transcendent eloquence and power? (Applause.) As citizens we are still proud to hold Dr Robertson enrolled as one of ourselves —a Burgess and Guild Brother of the old Burgh, and the friend of all. Ladies and gentlemen, a rich treat is in store for you, and I have now much pleasure in introducing Dr Robertson as the lecturer of the evening. (Applause.) Dr ROBERTSON, who received an enthusiastic reception, said—So you are all glad to see me again. (Great applause.) I am still more glad to see you. At one time, and indeed often after, I thought of the occasion when I should see your face no more. (Applatise.) I have been introduced as a guild brother of the burgh over which you sir, Provost Wright, so ably preside, and I well remember receiving the burgess ticket from my friend Provost Paterson. He told me the person who received it immediately before me was Disraeli—a great step, and a great step to his becoming Lord Beaconsfield. (Lauuhter.) To me it was an honour, and also a trouble, for immediately after a murder took place in the town, and the Provost told me that, being the youngest burgess, I would have to act as hangman ! (Laughter.) I have got to speak of Luther, aud if there is any honour in giving the sad old story, it is first due to my old church and the burgh of which I have still the honour of being a member. (Applause.) I have been in Germany during the last four weeks, and it Would be easy for me to tell things new as well as old; but what you want to hear is of Luther himself, the grand old man, and not what has been said about him in Germany 400 years after. You all know Luther well, but there are different ways of telling the story, and I would ask permission to do so in my own way. The bell tolls eleven. It is St. Martin's eve in the little Saxon town of Eialeben, a dark November night--the 10th November, 1483. The coated watchman, with lantern in hand, may be heard singing under the windows- "" Now -.r.y toasters let me tell, Eleven has struck on the old church bell,  Praise ye God the Lord. Just then was heard the first faint sound of a little voice afterwards destined to take up the truth and shout it through the world. It was the new-born babe Martin Luther. His mother a peasant's daughter, his father a miner's son, and even from the day Hans took Grits to be his wife, according to the literal form, they too lived and loved together in this miner's but, be the miner and she the miner's wife, darning the miner's hose. It is told that on the day when they went to Eisleben to make their winter markets there was no room for them in the inn, and in this Bethlehem in Germany shepherds were watching in the fields. ""Mx father was a peasant,"" Luther would say in after years, "" and a miner afterwards; but that I should become a doctor of divinity was surely not written in the stars."" No, Martin Luther, no; but there was one above the stars. At Mansfeld he was sent to school, where he was flogged ten or fifteen times a day, and well beaten, I can assure you. Even at home he was flogged, as father Hans was an austere man. Rough usage for you, Martin, but it betokens a will which will not yield to parental rule, and which will yet bring you into trouble when you come to struggle with God's holy law. The wastes that stretch round the Mansfebt village, the German miners who disappear from the daylight into the earth, the rearing furnaces that roar all night through the black pine woods, be sure all these will come back in your mind when you struggle in the convent. Then these headless goblins, not the gentle goblins or classical goblins, or like the elves or fairies in a Midsummer's .Night Dream, but the giants with which German literature is full. Thinking of this, Martin whistled to keep his courage up, but a something rings in his ' ear. Not a classical goblin, but one of the grim and grotesque which haunt the woods of Mansfeld. Think of this, and you will wonder less to find the devil Luther had to battle with, not the Mephestopheles of Goethe's Faust, but just that strange, blundering ditty with the chits and the horns, which !anther thought would require to be vanquished, not by the sword, or by faith, or by .prayer, but by something more practical, when taking the inkstand he dashed it at the Devil's head. (Laughter.) At this time the labouring life of Germany and of all Europe was straggling for emancipation from feudal vassalage. The brave burghers of Ghent—the weavers, 8000 in number, had marched away with the weaver's beam into liberty. These were the burghers of fermer days, and I am glad lam a double burgher of Irvine—(laughterl burghers are always on the side of the right. (Renewed laughter and applause.) But they were still struggling for freedom, and it only needed some one to arise and speak out in order to be the leader. That man was Martin Luther, who fought the battle, and won it too, when be stood before the diet at Worms, a prince yet a miner's son, who by his attitude gave freedom to the world. Meanwhile the furnaces at Mansfeld were burning cheerily, producing not only copper but gold to Hans, for he was appointed a councillor—a sort of Bailie Nicol Jarvie—and nothing would satisfy him but that he should send his son to college to develop his genius. So thinks Hans, but God in heaven has a different rule that lies in a thunderstorm and a convent, which helps him in Ins struggle with the Pope and the Devil. The University Court was too dry and rusty for his tastes, and the German Bible was more to his mind than Cicero and Virgil, nevertheless he studies hard, and at the vacation visits his parents. Something at this time is brooding over him, a trouble which he cannot explain. What is it, says Hans; perhaps the effect of recent illness. I'll tell you what it is. When in the library one day he finds a rare old book, the Latin version of the Bible, which he has read and studied, and which has shown him more of God's truth revealed to him an he knew about, or what his parents cared for him to know. The visit over at Mansfeld, he is returning to Erfurt through the woods, in a hot and sultry day. Thunder rolls over the town, and the riddle of life, the question of the awful sphinx, which meets us all on our life journey, but strangely so at the opening gates of manhood. This comes into the young man's mind :—What am I! Whence came I, and whether am I going? To hell! What, then, must I do? Be saved. The way to heaven lies through the monastery. But hark! what an awful peal of thunder rattles over the town.  "" Rolls of trumpet's shattering thunder Rends the realms of tombs asunder, Driving all the great throne under Death with nature, agonizes. All creation, startled, rises Summone.l to the drerl sashes; Open book all eyes engages, Bearing record of all ages Blazoned on its burning pages; Whence the Judge strict doom is dealing, Every hidden thought revealing, None escaping, none appealing.' And what, Luther, if the next thunderbolt should strike you dead? Is it not better you should be a monk, and save your soul by fastings and prayers? The clouds get darker, the lightning does not strike him, but turns up the earth beside him. Luther throws himself on the ground. Help! help! I will become a monk, and fast and pray. And so Luther's resolve to enter the monastery is made under God's glittering fire. (Applause.) The lights are kindled in the young teacher's chamber. At evening the student guests are entertaining themselves, drinking, smoking, and making merry. All at once Luther announces his intention of retiring to a convent. They are surprised, and remonstrate with him, but his mind is made up, and at night he knocks at the door of the monastery at Erfurt. The old monk, with his lamp, admits him, the door is clammed to, and he is seperated from the world for ever. The students came at night to see him, but permission is ref used; he is dead to the world, he may go to them but they cannot return to him. After sketching Luther's career in the monastery, giving an excellent exposition in regard to faith, the lecturer proceeded to sketch his history at Wittemberg, where the reformer speaks boldly as he ought to speak, full (4 fire, energy, anti resolution in short, the man is not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. From the Professor's chair he rises to the pulpit,—the carved old pulpit which I Web""' stood in—and where he als aye feared and I trembled when preaching to so many liemortal souls. Luther was none of your mere simpering teachers, made by the rule of matbernatim Not such a man Luther. He always reminds me of two Scotchmen, the one Dr Chalmers, and the other Robert Burns.

Hughes, was on Wednesday remitted to the Sheriff on a charge of having stolen £7 in bank notes, and a quantity of bed clothes, from his uncle, James M‘Gowan, residing in James Street, Calton, with whom he had been lodging since March last. It appears that M'Gowan, who is blind, kept the money m a purse, which was placed in an unlocked chest. Taking advantage of his uncle's infirmity, Ilughes occasioanlly carried away a note, being careful always to substitute the leaf part of an old copy of the New Testament which happened to be in thu I house. the old man suspected nothing till after the removal of the seventh note, when it seems the nephew, for want of another New Testament leaf, bad substituted a piece of grey paper. On feeling and com.ting over the supposed notes, as was his daily custom, M'Gowan was struck wills the peculiar stiffness of one of their number, and communicated his doubts to a neighbour, who at once informed him of their real character. By this time, however, Hughes had taken the precaution to absent himselt, carrying with him the bundle of bed clothes referred to; but on the circumstances being reported to the police on Wednesday last, a strict search was made, which resulted in Isis apprehension on Monday. Tho whole of the stolen clothes have been recovered, but unfortunately not a penny of the money was found upon the thief, who seems to have lost no time in converting it into drink. "

This was an attack on the property of the Church, and cautioned the House against entertainiagit. Mr. FITZGERALD replied to the opponents of the bill, contending that the existence of the tax engendered discontent, and was injurious alike to Protestant and Roman Catholic occupiers.  Lord J. RUSSELL said he was not satisfied with the statement that the necessity for the bill arose from the nature of the payment. The mode of collections by the corporations he admitted had been a failure. There was then one act upon which this measure was justified. Lord Derby's act relating to church cess, which act effected £70,000 a-year of rates—an amount which was vexatious to the people.

The officer reported that he came upon their rear guard retiring in good order, but that the road in many places was strewed with property and equipm.nts. The loss of the Persians has been estimated at 200 killed, among whom was an officer of rank and estimation, Brigadier Agha Jan Khan, who fell in the northern battery. Not a casualty occurred to our army, and the entire loss of the squadron was five killed and eighteen wounded. The whole affair reflects much credit upon the efficiency of our much-belied navy, to which of course belongs all the glory of the success.  preFipit-?.1,  after  explodi  Our last advices from the Gulf are dated Mohammerah, April 3, at which date the troops were healthy, and the weather continued cold and stormy. A camp had just been marked out for the whole division. It is very desirable to withdraw the troops as early as practicable, but fears are entertained that the approach of the south. west monsoon may necessitate their stay in the Gulf till it is over. Without proper lodging and accommodation, and exposed to the heat and malaria of the lowlands of Persia, much sickness may be expected, and we look apprehensively forward to the next few months. At Bushire all was quiet, under the command of Colonel Jacob. The troops were healthy and longing for activity. The Persians in considerable force were still hanging about in the plain and at the foot of the bills, but it was not expected they would venture an attack.  A truly tragic episode of thia miserable Persian war is the death, each by his own band, of the late Commander of the Forces, General Stalker,i. and the Commodore of the Navy, Captain Ethersey. These melancholy events occurring within two days of each other, are plainly attributable to identical causes, remote and immediate.. Both men should have been in Europe on sick leave, instead of directing operations in the Gulf. In each instance the nervous system was evidently shattered by the climate' and quite unequal to encounter, except under the influence of casual strong excitement, the extraordinary responsibility thrust upon it. For some days prior to the 14th ultimo, on which the unhappy General destroyed himself, it was observed that he was unusually depressed, and it is generally believed that recent heavy pecuniary losses had come to supplement the harassing responsibilities of his position, and destroy the energies already undermined by disease, and fainting under an exaggerated estimate of what was required from him. It was determined that he should command at Bus in the absence of General Outram, who I conduct the operations against Mohammerah, and he seems to have imagined that the force tb be left at his disposal was inadequate to the service. There is not the shadow of a suspicion that any unpleasantness occurred between him and General Out ram, a friendship the most chivalric and ardent subsisting between them. They breakfasted together in the company of the staff on the morning of his death, and no one observed any alteration in his manner. Ho rose from the table, and having called upon several of his staff, all of whom unhappily were out, proceeded to his own tent, whore a pistol shot was heard ten minutes afterwards, and the unhappy General was found in the agony of death. Several of the witnesses testify to his nervous and undue apprehension for the health of the troops during the approaching hot weather. Certalts it is, the men and officers loved the gallant old man, who thus cared for them with no ordinary love, and his memory saddens every heart. It is but right to add that one of the witnesses on the inquest, Colonel Lugard, asserts his strong belief that the explosion of the pistol was accidental. The verdict, however, determined that the General destroyed himself while in a fit of temporary insanity. The gloom that was cast over the camp by this melancholy event was to be deepened ere long by another equally, if not more painful. On the morning of the 16th ultimo, two days after the death of Stalker, a rumour spread through the camp that the commodore of the navy, Captain Ethersey, had destroyed himself in the night, and but too well founded was it. It had been matter of remark for some time that the commodore, a most able and talented man, was suffering from mental excitement of no ordinary kind, and it is much to be regretted that a too nice sense of honour should have kept him with the force when his state evidently demanded that he should invalid for a time. A strong aod apparently wellfounded suspicito is very prevalent that Sir Henry Leeke's conduct towards this unhappy gentleman was the cause of his mental distress. It is certain that on the night of his death he had been poring over despatches recently reerived from Sir Henry, and a memorial to the government of Bombay lay beside them on his dressing table. It would seem that, tired and confused, sick and in despair, he at last placed the pistol at his head and destroyed himself. These despatches and that memorial were sprinkled with his blood; but if wears to believe the government account of the inquest, none of these documents were looked into to find the cause of that madness which they agreed had led to the act. The conclusion is inevitable. The known tyranny of the man —his unjust supercession of Captain Ethersey when the expedition sailed, and the well-known fact that they were on terms of hostility with each other, make it impossible for any hoe to be satisfied with the verdict as it stands. It is said that Sir Henry Leek° goes home immediately. A general feeling of dissatisfaction exists as to the terms of the peace. It is felt that if these are all we went to war for, we had better simply have suspended relations with Persia, and left her to herself.  Bushire, would  The Bengal papers are filled with the particulars of the mutiny of the 19th Regiment of Native Infantry, which has ended in the disbandment of the corps, and the spread of disaffection to the 34th Regiment of Native Infantry. TIIO original pretence of the mutineers was that they were supplied with cartridges in the manufacture of which some animal impurity was used that it would defile a Brahmin to touch, The fact terns out to be that it is the old story of a demand for increase of pay. The most dangerous feature in these mutinies is the combination of the men, and to render 'lochs combination an impossibility one would think was the dictate of common sense. The danger of forming a regiment of 800 Brahmins Is as conspicuous as that of forming one of 800 Mussulmen, and until the Bengal army be remodelled in this respect it will ever be liable to the dangerous disaffections by )vhich it has of late years been characterised. Caste is the bane of that army, and until it is trampled out of its constitution the state will ever be moving with a mine under its foundation.

Two English and two French ships of the line and eight steamers are anchored in the Bosphorus. 25,000 Turks have crossed at Widths. BERLIN, Nov. 10.—The Prussian Moniker, in it. account of the affair of the 2d, says that the Russian cavalry could not act in consequence of the marshy native of the ground. Prince Gortschakoff has congratulated the troops on the gallantry they displayed. A despatch from Vienna, of the 9th,statea that the Turks, having at first been driven out of Oltenitza, returned to the charge, continued the action for 28 hours, and remained masters of the field of battle. The defeated Russians retired on Bucharest. BccHAREST, Oor. 31,—The members of the council appointed by Prince Stirbey have paid their respects to Prince Gortschakoff. The Prince addressed them with great haughtiness, and told them to be careful lest they inourred the displeasure of the Czar. He added that whoever was guilty of spreading false rumours would be hanged at once, and without trial. Orden had been issued to transport all victuals, Sic., from the frontier at least six miles into the interior. PARIS, SATURDAY, HALF-FAST 8 A.M.—The Moniker contains an article refining the assertion"" made in the Russian msnifesto. It proves that it is Russia and not Turkey that has violated treaties, and it is not correct, it says, to state that the principal powers of Europe have sought in vain by their exhortations to shake the blind obstinacy of the Ottoman government. A telegraphic despatch of the 31st ult., from Constantinople, confirms the report of a battle near Batoum. PARIS, FRIDAY EVENING.—The Count de Nesselrodt has addressed a note to all the Ministers, representatives of Russia at the different courts of Europe, with instruction to communicate it to the different governments. This important document Is dated the 31st of October, and the following is the substance of it. The Emperor of Russia recalls to mind all his preceding declarations with regard to his firm determination (vodente) not to attack or injure the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, and repeat/inlet he has occupied the principalities merely for the purpose of having in his hands a material guarantee until he shall have obtained the moral satisfaction to whirls he has a right on the part of Turkey. The Count de esselrods adds that in the peesent struggle Russia will limit her operations, and remain on the defensive. She will not pass the Danube. The Emperor recommends the powers not to aggravate the state of affairs by an intervention which would produce general embarrassment, but to leave to that war its local character. H. even recommends to them to continue their pacific negotiations, to which he will, give his assistance, without sacrificing any of his principal demands (reelantations.) The note concludes with the following significant words: The Emperor of Russia will regulate his future conduct by that of England and of France.' 51. de Eisseleff communicated this note yesterday to Drouyn de Llinys, and in doing so completed the communication by adding verbally, in the name of the Czar, that if a single English or French ship should pass into the Black See, he should consider it as a declaration of war. It is stated, on good authority, that the French government has decided in council that 25,000 men shall be sent to Turkey, if the Emperor of Russia should persist in a coarse of aggression, or demand pecuniary indemnity as the condition of his discontinuing it. No order has been given by the Minister of War on the subject. The vendiug or not sending of a body of troops will depend partly on the state of affairson the Danube, and partly on the despatches from Baraguay d'Hilliers. It will be only when pacific means shall be no longer availing that it will make still more open manifestations.than the sending of the fleet through the Dardanelles. TRANCE.

SCOTS APPEALS.  House of Lords, March 3. THE. SCOTTISH MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY r. TURNER  AND OTHERS. This waa an appeal againat a decree of the Court of Session in a suit instituted by the owners of the ship Laurel, to recover a sum of £l,OlO for freight insured on that vessel, with interest thereon. The case was argued on Feb. 15th and 17th, by Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Willes, for the appellant.; and by Sir F. Kelly and Mr. Sergeant Byles (Mr. Burnie was with them), for the respondents. . . - •  The House had taken time to consider the case. The Logo CHANCELLOR now moved the judgment of the House. The appellants in this ease contended that there held not been a loss by the perils insured against, and, prima facie, it was clear that there had been none, for the ship had arrived, the cargo had been delivered, and the freight paid. But the respondents insisted that there bad been such a lota, because, as there had been a total loss of ship, admitted in the House itself to be occasioned by the perils of the sea, and as the insurer on ship had, therefore, been allowed to recover the freight, the .soured contended that there had been to him a loss of the freight, occasioned by the perils of the sea, and that he was consequently entitled to recover the amount against the underwriter on freight. But this reasoning could not be supported. The case of 'Chapman v. Benson' —in which Lord Chief-Justice Tindal had said in judgment that where a ship had been abandoned, and the assured on ship had thus lost the freight, he would be entitled to recover the freigh t against the underwriter on freight— was not in point with this case. For there the abandonment took place before the vessel was brought into port and the freight earned, while here the cargo had been delivered before the abandonment took place, and the underwriter on ship had merely been allowed to set off the freight received against his liability to loss on the iosunince on ship. The underwriter on freight merely guaranteed that freight should be earned; here it had been earned and received, and the fact that the owner of the ship had afterwards been obliged to pay it over, or to allow it in account with other persons, was no reason for fixing the underwriter on freight with liability to a charge on account of his guarantee, for that guarantee had been completely performed. His Lordship therefore moved that the judgment given by the Court below in favour of the pursuers, the owners of the ship, should be reversed.  Lord Tana° expressed, in a very elaborate judgment, hie entire concurrence with the opinion of his noble and learned friend.  Judgmeut of the Court below reversed.  LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S TACTICS. (From the Morning Herald.)  Lord John Russell has a sort of malicious satisfaction in taunting his Protectionist opponents with their rejection of his offer' in 1840, of an fis duty. ' If,' says his Lordship, 'you had listened to me then, in preference to your faithless adviser, the late Sir Robert Peel, you might have had the question finally settled, and you would now have had the advantage of a protective duty.' Now this sounds all very plausible, and perhaps some of our agricultural mends, when they hear this language, are led to lament that they were induced to reject this tempting offer. We think, however, they have no cause for regret; for nearly about the same time the noble Lord made another offer, in • different direrwhich those to whom it was made did accept, rely__ itpcia4sia Lordship's good faith, but thew new find that they trusted to a broken reed. 'Consent,' said the noble Lord and his agents to the Protestant inhabitants of Upper Canada, 'to the union with the lower province, and we will pass, before that union is proclaimed, a incisors securing to you, and finally disposing of, the property which is set apart for religious purposes in your province.' And the inhabitants of Upper Canada listened to the voice of the charmer. They accepted his offer, and at the moment he did fulfil his promise, and got the Parliament to pass what he declared to be • ' final act.' A few years afterwards the d octrinte of colonial self-govern.  OW. wn....i•eaPcxe4* 'Av trusted  meal became more fashionable. Mixed with some truth, there is a deal of false and foolish jargon talked upon this subject. Lord John adopts it all. What is it t,o him that he made an offer, and that the offer was accepted, and that through his instrumentality the Imperial Parliament pieded themselves to the bargain? Are these paltry considerations of national honour and good faith to stand in the way of the full development of the majestic principle of colonial self-government? Oh, no There Is Sir William Molesworth---he must be enabled to justify himself to tin friends for joining and remaining in the Cabinet of Lord Aberdeen. There is the braes band. A sly blow to church establishments in general will tell with them. There are the honest advo.  ;arcs of colonial self-government. They will be pleased at whatever carries out their theories. Pledges may be disregarded—but the administration will in • mannee be strengthened. After this treatment, then, of the Canadians, we ask, what was the worth of his offer to the Protectionists of an 8s duty Precisely of the same value as his pledge to the Canadians precisely of the same value as his pledge that the Reform Bill was a final measure. The Bs duty would have been abandoned by him the first moment that it suited his political convenience to abandon it, and pleasing pastime as it may be to him to laugh at the Protectionists for having rejected his offer, the Protectionists may console themselves with the reflection that had -they accepted it he would equally have laughed at them toe baying been weak enough to trust him.

IN THE NORTH.  The committee charged with the procuring of the survey of the proposed railway through Sutherland and Caithness had a meetinr, with Mr Mitchell, C.E., in the Town Hall of Wick—the Earl of Caithness in the chair. Mr Mitchell intimated to the meeting that he could take the railway from Helmsdale to the Ord by the coast route, but that he thought it was next to impossible to take it across the valley into Caithness, and he was therefore of opinion that the only way in which it could be brought into that county was to make a detour and bring it round the Ord. He had already found an opening in the range at Achintoul, by which an entry into Caithness might be effected ; but his surveyors were searching for an opening nearer the coast. The committee were almost unanimously of opinion that the line should be brought down to the coast again  at a point as near Dunbeath as practicable, and continued thence by Lybster to Wick. Mr Mitchell mentioned that the route by the centre of the county, through Halkirk, with a fork to Wick and Thurso respectively, was not longer; if not shorter. than the one proposed totind the Ord arid ley the coast, bit none of the mombets of committee seemed to think favourably of a route that Would not take up the local traffic of the coast villages and fishing stations. Mr Mitchell intimated that he thought lie gam, his Way to make a good line into Caithness, but he was not prepared as yet to indicate the precise route, as it might happen that before the survey its ctfinpleted he might discover a better one. The Duke of Sutherland Would not go to Parliament for the Siitheriand portion to Helmsdale separately; the whole line must be done as one scheme, and he vias afraid they Cotild fiardly he ready this year.

The -Object of the Bill was to express in a clear Manner the real intentions of the law. He had two objects in view, one was to make the enactments of the existing Act Moro clear, the other to abolish picketing as an offence. , • After a discussion, . _ Lord Elcho moved the adjournment of the debate.' Mr. Bruce admitted that there had been wale very singular decisions, under the Act, especially for the offpnce of picketing, as it was called, being the act of watching workmen with a view to their coercieu. He could not; how Over, conient to remove picketing from the category of special offences, nor did he think it would be proper to discuss such important questions as were connected with this Bill at so advanood,an hour in the morning, .  Mr. Henry James—l thiek, sir, no one can compliin of the tone assumed by the noble lord, the member for Huntingdonshire ; but he must allow me to say that I can regard his motion for an adjournment in ,uo, other sense than a direct negative to the second., reading . :of the Bil. If the motion for adjournment be 'carried, it must •be evident to every one that this Bill will net be read a second time during OA proitent Session of Parliainent, and the noble lord must bear the responsibility of this rejection of the Measure. Now, sir, I am very anxious .to see this Bill passed into law. I have shown no false sympathy towards working men, but ',believe ihat if the law continue as it now is they have a substantial grievance which ought to be redrcsad. It this injuStice does exist, it is no antwer to say that it is at too early an hour of the morning for us to discuss a pill that shall remedy that injustice. Why, I Well remember that it was at a litter, or rather an eat her, hour that we passed the , • Act of last year; which we are now. seeking to rep'eal. (Mr. Bruce:""We Vegan this discussion :it an earlier hour."") True, that May be; but there era men who have been discussing that niettstitis ever since—l mean, the men Who ere subjected to utid have suffered from its unjust provisions But, sir, it is not too late to discuss this Bill on its merits. Its objects are -simple. They are to repeal an Act which ie. so ill.duiwn, that yntler it men .nre.. conitantly convicted Of that whielt,l belleye obe no Morel or legal crime. A ijudge whe genOally speakti ont boldly tied ekpressep hi Oj,ttltofl —I mean ,Mr. Baron Bramwell—has plainly said that riCketting is no offence if ndaccompanied by violence.

Why, may he not bring his, power of Persuasion to bear in the smile way as employee may? Pray, remember, that under this Bill a man will be punished for any act tending to coerce or molest.

Mr. Corrance supported the Bill. .. Mr. Mundell% hoped that the HOIIS6 would discuss so important a question even at that late hour in the morning. It could not be denied that tinder the existing Act some exceedingly harsh convictions had taken place. Men had been imprisoned and put on the treadmill for simply passing up and down before the door. Did the noble lord who was so anxious to shelve this Bill remember that during the whole of the week he , had been exerting himself to hedge the mine owners round with all Bolts of protection Would the House consent to send a master to th e treadmill for an offence which was equivalent to picketing.

TECHNOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT 1 FARMER WARDLE'S I WAGGERS.  SPINNING.  BY LECTUS.  THE LOON COMM.  THE NIPPER MECHANISM.  We may state at onoe that this is not erectly a new comber which we are bringing before the notioe of our madam in this week's article, but we ere applying a new name to the now well-known Nesmith cumber. We propose this week to deal briefly with the one distinctive mechan6al arrangement which at. °Doe arrests the attention of any mill man when first lookat the headstock of this maohino. We elltide now to the orank and crank arm arrangement for operating the nippels, and to the sweeping forward and backward movement imparted to the nippers, top comb feed roller, by muerte of this crank arrangement.' In watching the working of them central organs of the comber one is involuntarily reminded of the reciprocating movement of the laths of a loon), and the resemblance is still further rendered apparent when we examine the crank and crank arm arrangement for controlling the 111 ppers. To the mind of the preeent writer, the more one watches and considers the construction, operation, and adjustment of this mechanical combination, and the more ooe analyses thews things in regard to the objects aoaght to be , obtained from the use of nippeni, feud toiler, and top oomb, the more one is disposed to admire the happy combination and &dap tab ility of the whole business. _ _  THE CENTRAL ORGANS. In this comber the objects sought end oh-1 tained, and the central organs employed for 1 the purpose are in • sieves very much the , same as in the Hellmann. That is to say, in , the Hellmann we here feed cullers, detaching , rollers, nippers, and top comb, all mitred j around • revolving combing cylinder., Equally j we find these five central organs in the as-'N meth, with not one taken away, and not an- ! other ooe added to aciomplish the operations &scenery in oottoo combing. Neither are the essential and fundamental principles or duties of these central parts altered, although they are in almost every one intensified and brought out more fully. In both machince we I have the root princtipkw of intermittent feeding . of the cotton iu short lengths, the pueltivo) combing action of the cylinder needles upon , the front portions of the fibres, the combing of the rear portions of the fibres by drawing through • top comb, and the detaching and delivery of the finally combed „fibres. Every cos of these five central organs, however, ham reeeived the attention of • master mind, and * bolder conception has been reduced to actual bed successful working practice in regard to atoll one of these flue central organs. Four tletarbing rollers are used instead of three, and Se detaching roller is allowed to touch the eylinder. The cylinder contains the usual 17 rows of needles, but no fluted segment; the nippers move axon the top of the cylinder instead of having a more vertical action, the top comb has an altogether bolder movement, and ioily one feed roller is used as against two in the Hellmann. In this way the five central organs ben all been &Irma in constructional I detail, and apparently with a-very die finite and I well attained purpose. 4.. ,  THE CRANK MOTION  A. stated, a dominant feature of the headMock is the crank and crank arm combination for operaung the nippers, the feed roller, and the top comb, the two latter being carried in the same swing freme, and depending for their operation entirely upon the rocking of the loog nipper abaft and subsidiary conneetimis. Apart from results, one cannot but admire the silent, smooth, powerful manner in which this crank arrangement ckwe its work of rocking the nippier shaft. A peculiar feature of this combination is that the forward movement of the nippers is made more slowly than the return movement, due to the effective length of the crank kern being much longer for the forward than for the return movement of the nippers. The one favours the mare prolonged feeding sod detaching operations, while the Latter may help to put a good finish on the detaching. The bold swinging movement of the nippers and allied parts at once gives a (thane for friends to point out merits, and others to offer criticisms of this comber as compared with the Heilmann, but there is no arguing against the amount of practical adoption of the newer machine. At present there appears to be a definite position for both styles of comber, aod in this abort article we are not deposed to deal with this phew of the queetion, but must leave the matter to individual judgment for individual cows. A distinctive feature of the nipper action is that its movement is over the top of the cylinder, so that excess or prolonged movement does not muse the Dipper to bOBOll the cylinder. There are some who argue that the fixed mention of the nippers, a• in the Heilmenn, during cylinder combing is the beet method of petting the niationim combing effect from the cylinder needles. Corning back to the construction and action of the parts connected with the nippers on the Vesmith comber. We have e plained bow the long nipper shaft is rocked by the crank combination. For each head of the comber this king nipper shaft is oonnected by brew and short connecting rode to whet is termed the nipper bridge, there being two connecting rods for each nipper. It 4 sufficiently convenient by these. connection() to adjoin the nipper jaws parallel to and the correct distance from the long steel detaching roller. The crank arm is not directly secured to the lone nipper shaft, but is connected therewith through the medium of two adjusitmeat screws and a suitable bracket, so that the distance of all the nippers on the machine from the detaching rollers may be altered quickly and away at one operation. Each top nipper arm has a (separate fulercun in the bridge, and each one carries a bowl on its lower extremity which comes against an adjustable incline no as to open the nippers as they more forward_ When the nipper movee hack ready for cylinder combing the bowl leaves the incline. and thus permits suitable springs to clove the nipper and grip the fibres. It is claimed for this retina ""that the opening and closing take place gently, and without hammering."" It is not usual to apply a mashie/1 of leather. Miler, or any other materiel to the nippers of the Nesmith comber. "

Very little attention was paid to business during the pest week, and in spite of the threatened .3tAmpage of the cotton mills the festive season was well kept up by the people. At the time of writing there is only one question being deemeed on 'Change, and that is ""what is going to happen in Lancashire?"" 'Phe question has been answered by the vice-cheirmen of the Fxnployers' Aesociation, who states that it would be a suicidal policy for spinning mills to be kept at work while the weaving sheds were clawed. No reasonable minded individual can find (atilt with such a statements and we can make up our minds that we are in for some lively time. Thetis are two sides to the non-union question, as both organised employers as well as operatives have grievances agair.t those who ref.se to join their resnectise associations, and we hear that the operatives decline to astist the employers in bringing pret.ure to bear en employers and limited companies which refuse to join the Employers' Association, and it is because of the reason named that the employers refuse to discharge non-union operatires. A mutual asdorits' ought to be arrived at on such matters, otherwise the cotton industry will be kept in an uneettled state, to the great detriment of all parties concerned. . .  In anticipation of coming events lousiness is very quiet in this centre, as well Co in Liverpool. There are no new features cowling to light which affects the general situation of cotton, the statisticad position of which is still of a bearish character, and will be as for many months to come, owing to the crop beim such a large one. The holding back policy is little hoard of now, and cotton movements are on large lines. New York operators have failed to meats a snare for increasing Wires, and financial losses are talked about in busineira circles. The cotton market was open on thrsi days during, the week, and snimrers were only in moderate attendance. Buying was strieted to small quantities, and Pricen remained unchanged on the bahuice of ups and downs. Arnerica,n was in fair request in the early cart of the week for export to the Continent, and this fact caused sellers to raise their quotations, but the advances were lest later on, as there was pressure to sell, and in conseqnence of the American markets displaying much weakness the tone in Liverpool ruled decidedly against sellers. The transactions 111 futures were few, and of small consequence. Prices for American are practically the same as a week ago, but Egyptian lost 3-64 d. The sales of spot cotton totalled 27,000 balm, including 3,500 bales for export or speculation. The week's irnporta total .4,634 bales. American futures closed at 4.87 i for December delivery. The were market has been rather quiet during the week, ant whilst prices have been steady trio market has become somewhat unsettled by. the week's occurrences in the weaving districts.. On  the few days-;hichlaZe-been available for neon transactions have been mainly of an unimportant character, and more with the view of satisfying urgent requirements, which have not as a rule repreesnted much trade. Probably most users no fairly well oevered in yarn against their previous sales, and thee° who are not fully covered may have been in the humour to await the further development of the preamt interesting and awkward situation- I,•tpinsices have made little change in quotations, but have generally been prepared to go on selling at the prices which they have recently obtained. Evidently speculators In the raw material have had a market of their own lately, for in tspite of the larger eetimates put forth values have apparently been more inclined to harden than to give way. Yarn users have not bought largely during the'week, although in sonic instances they have sold cloth rather freely, and jset before the market closed for the Ck' trietmas holidays the tuicertainties of the pontiai were SO prominently put forth that yarn buying wasappar ently about the last thing that anybody thought of. In the meantime, aerate-1g more definite information, deliveries have gone on steadily, spinners having extensive order lista generally, and being under no neeeelity to de much selling in ender to dispose readily of their full production. In detail i there s very little alterations on the week, the demand for varioue counte and qualities being fairly well spread. A very steady tone has prevailed thrtmehout the cloth market, and in several directione business has been fairly active. Manufacturers maintain their strong position very well so far, and are under urgent pressure to execute their contracts as previously arranged. A fairly extensive inquiry has been about, and for some of the large markets orders of coneidenible importance lna re been spewed for dt•livery well forvrard into the ieennil half of peat year. Notwithstanding the expectation of very hienn cotton supplies. there has bech evident confidence in the comparative ssfoty nsf cermet quotationo for the raw material, and where martufacturenn have been in the humour to give way ee.n moderately additional extensive engagemente have been entered into. Merchants buy without alesitation from reasonable sellers where they have definite birsineu in hand. For India there has been a good inquiry. and a hearings of some importance has linen arranged. Trade for China has not been any worse, but in net only Tine nearer foreign markets onnAne purchases to ro-dinary requirements. Printing cloths have occasionally been in moderate demand. In the home trade a steady tone prevails, and sellers are well engaeed throughout. "

He should like to know by whose authority it hod been placed there, as was a public footpath, and the stile had been taken up for the gate to be erected in its place. The Surveyor said the gate had been erected at the instanoe of Mr. Job Edwards, but he had given him notice to remove it.  .TEMDSMSFOR_PAVIN? MATERIALS._  ___---- - -------.

The committee recommended the acceptsuce of the lowest tender. Agreed to. THE NESTE CROFT ROADS. The Highway Committee reported that they had visited the district of flesty Croft, and after perambn. lating the streets and approaches thereto they were of opinion that both required immediate attention. The streets already made were much out of repair, and in many places the curbing and channelling was being seriously damaged by cart wheels passing over them, a practice which should be stopped. With regard to the ap• preaches, the committee recommended that these roads be curbed and channelled, beginning with Hyde's-lane, continuing on to the Cross Road which unites the two streets leading into Meaty Croft, and finishing with Rudding•lane. Before proceeding with the work the committee considesed it desirable that an estimate of the cost involved be prebented to the Board by the SOveyer. at the earliest possible moment, with the view of snaking good progress before the winter set in. The Chairman stated that the surveyor was unable to be present when the committee met; and, after a few words of explanation, the matter was referred for the consideration of the next meeting. "

One of the most painful features observable during the present season is the multitude of barefooted of tiiirry-c.ad children to be met with in our large towns, particularly in the North. In some cases povert) may doubtless be pleaded in extenuation for this practice, but in others no valid excuse can be offered. There itre parents who ignorantly pride themselves on their contempt for sentiment, and tteat their children with almost Spartan severity, slowing them to run about with head and feet thus ecovered, or insufficiently protected from the weather, with the vain notion Of "" hardening"" them, the natunil emisequence being cats vi h, bronchitis, plithisis, and a culpable, because preventable increase of infant mei -rlity. It is well known that the Scotch are specially noted for their disregard of clothing the lower extremities. Many persons fail to recognise the fact that children aro not all blessed with similar eonstitutions ; some of robust frames are able to brave all Tar ations of teniperature with comparative impunity, whilst th; arr.ikly speedily succumb under the trial. Nor is this ovil confined to the poor; the midche and upper classes at this holiday season frequently err by the pernicious custom of clothing for evrning parties gossamer dresses, thin shoes, and socks initial of warm stockings. A little reflection on these points should tech parents that attention to the dictates of common sense, if not of humanity, may possibly prevent much future anxiety to thenselves and sullen i g to their offspring.

A.bollt Wen o'clock on Saturday evening, the landlord of the house, 180, Gray'sdnn.road, London, on calling for kin rent, wan surprised to hear cries of "" Murder I "" from an upper room, and on going up to the front room of the second floor, which was occupied by a family named Maeleran, discovered the husband, a law writer, aged 53, kneeling upon his wife and apparently endeavouring to strangle her. He tore himself away from the constable and the landlord, and then he in the most determined manner put his fingers in two wounds he had made it. his throat, and pulled out his wind-pipe. Aotingdospector Bannister, G division, was called, and found the man lying on the floor with his head nearly severed from the body, and the walls sad floor besmeared with blood. Dr. Morton was at once in attencanae, and he pronounced life extinct. Poe wife was in tools a distressed state of mind as to be unable to give the police any information as to the horrible circumstances under whioh her husband made away with himself. LOST ON TEE BaliB&RA. SANDS.—On Sunday night the eohooner Kuhn, of Greenock, from Thurso for Great Yarmouth, laden with paving , stones, was totally lest on the Barbera Sand, three ' miles from thie place, during very wild and stormy ,I weather. The crew, five in all, were rescued by the ' Caistor lifeboat men and the crew of one of the Yarmouth eteamtuge which had been engaged to assist in the service. The shipwrecked men were , landed at Great Yarmouth, and received at the I Sailors' Home.  SERIOUS CHARGE OF POISONING.—At the poliee.conrt, Stockton, a man named Kinder wan charged with poisoning eight children. Prisoner is a boatman, and had collected a quantity of what was considered an unknown kind of root. He brought it to the quayside, where some children seem to have found a portion of it, which they ate. Symptoms of poisoning subsequently appeared, three children dying, and several others only eimaping narrowly. The root is believed to be water bemlook, and a very deadly poison. Priaoner, who is said lobe very sorry, was remanded for a week on bail. EXTRAORDINARY SHIPPING SPECTACLE AT Lryzarooz.—The stormy weather whieh prevailed at Liverpool for bettered weeks without interruption °lased an enormona ...emulation of storm-bound ships in the port and up the Mersey, the number in dock °leered for foreign parts being no fewer than , 193. The change from boisterous and adverse winds to a favourable breeze from the N N.E., therefore I resulted in bringing about one of the most extraordinary spectacles which the Mersey had ever preempted No fewer than fifty-three vessels took their departure, a number which would doubtless have been trebled but for the extraordinary lowness of the tide. In addition to these the immense number of 350 coasters of all desoriptions left, the whole I forming a grand prooeasion, which took two houra in passing. DAMAGES AGAINST RAILWAY COMPANIES.— Damages to the amount of .31200 have been given in 1 an action brought at the Devon Assizes against the South Western Railway. The plaintiff (S. ft. Jahni son) was it jerod seven years ago on tie same line, and received £3OO, but subsequently, his injuries proving permanent, he received another £lOO and a free pals.

On Saturday night, during a furious N.N.W. gale, a large steamer was driven ashore on the coast of Cornwall, between St. Ivesand the Land'e End. She was seen just before dusk hoieting distress signals, but nothing was done. About midnight, pilots ob. serving light., got ready a boat, but before it was launched it was observed that the lig'at belonged to an open boat, which rapidly drifted on to rough water at the bar and oapsized. The boat was then driven on Pendever Racks; the cries of drowning men were distinctly heard and Bonne men observed clinging to the boat. A pilot, fastening a rope round him, dashed into the surf, and was driven back almost dead. Soon after, bags of clothes a,Ad oars were washed ashore, and at daybreak a steamer was dircovered on the rocks down the coast. Tre mendous seas were breaking over her, and within a few lours she was dashed into fragment., her gradual break up being witnessed by crows of spectators. No living thing came ashore from her, nor could she be reached ; but six dead bodies have been washed ashore and papers showing the steamer to be the Isabel, bound from La Rochelle to Bristol. It is be. lieved that her crew numbered thirty, and undoubtedly all have perished. Of the wreok itself nothing remains vieible but shattered planks.  THE GREAT BELGIUM BANK FRAUDS. At Bow. street Eugene Hint was charged, under the Extradition Acts, before Sir Thomas Henry, with lemony from the Bargee de Belgique to the amount of between six and even millions of francs. Mr. Albert interpreted. The prisoner was brought to the court in custody of Chief Inspector Drusoovich and Sergeant A. Marohand, ef Scotland.yard. Csief Constable Mahe, or Queenstown, proved that he al-reefed the prisoner in consequence of telegrams he had received from Superintendent Williamson, of S fot. land-yard, on board the City of Paris, bound for New York. He woo accompanied by two female., one of whom he was authorised to arrest by a telegram from the Flesh° Prosecutor at Brussels. Wit. flee was also told to take all jewels, &1., from the prisoner and his mistrees (the woman with him) The woman was arrested and taken before the local magietrate, who, upon representation made by 'the Belgian Consul, allowed her to be discharged. Witness produced a liet of bonds and other valuable dome. ments found on the prisoner. Prisoner, through the interpreter, objeoted to the word ""on."" He said they were not found in his possession. They were belonging to the lady that was with him.  Prisoner said all he wished was to go book to his country no justify himself.  The Belgian officer said prisoner would be charged with forgery. Sir Thomas said in that case he must be claimed for that. At present he was only olaimed for larceny, and if he was surrendered only for that he oould not be tried for may other offence. It would therefore be better to remand Ym a week to ascertain whether the Belgian Government wished to claim him for forgery as well.  A RUNAWAY HICAREIN. An inquiry took place at Widfm d, near Chelmsford, respuning the death of Charles Grett Doig, a gardener in the ser• vice of Mr. Arthur Pryor. The deceased and Mr. Pryor'a head gardener were walking to Chelmsford, and, seeing a funeral hearse etanding at a public. house door, accepted the offer of a ride.

When at the age of 90, he one morning started at four o'clook for the shore, a long distance from his house, carrying a sail, two gums, and a bucket, on his shoulders, and from thence went alone in his dory on a fishing trio. Re reached his home again at seven o'olook that evening, with twenty large fish, as the result of hie ex.mrsion, and the next day felt ixo fatigue ther'efroin.

(I'rom the "" Melbourne Argus."")  Colonel A. B. Steinberger, the late Premier of Samoa, whose name has become well known through the recent disturbances in those islands, which resulted in his 'arrest and deportation, arrived in Melbourne, just before the last mail left, from New Zealand. He purposed leaving by the outgoing mail steamer for London, where he intends to bring the proceedings of Captain Stevens, commander of the Barracouta, under the notice of the British Government, and also to claim redress for the tiltev,ed injuries he has suffered. He states that in 1873 be woo sent out by the United States Government as special commissioner to Samoa, in order to report upon the eh:trader of the islands, their extent, population; resources, As., and, in fact, to obtain all the information possible it. tile interests of the United States ,Government. After spending eight months in thn islands, during which time he created a Government on a settled basis, lie returned to the United States, and furnished his report to the Government. In February, 1875, he returned to Samoa, accredited as special commissioner for the United States, with sealed instructions from the Secretary of State. and with a sealed letter from the President of the United States addressed to tho native chiefs. lie 'wns warmly welcomed by the natives, and after a little time, at the earliest request of the entire native population and the bettogclass of the whites, lie accepted the position of Premier. In endeavouring to improve the position of the natives, be aroused the hostility of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, especially Dr. Gee Turner, and many of the white population. The American consul, Mr. S. S. Foster, who he Rays, had a persenal hostility against him, joined with the missionaries in an intrigue to secure his deportation froin the island, and on the arrival of H.M.S. Barracouta on December 12, they. 'induced Captain Stevens to interfere. After the collision between the natives and the Barrneouts, which wns attended with loss of life, the vessel remained at Samoa until recalled on Mareh 29, and then proceeded to Fiji, where Colonels Stemberger and One were landed, and afterwards on to Anekland. Mr. Coe after being released at Fiji, proceeded at once to the United States to lay the matter before:the Washington Government.

I never said that your daughter wee illegitimate. I never said that you were not in lady, or that you were a drunkard. In reply to the Bench, the prisoner said she did not deny breaking the glass, and that she would be very glad to pay for it. If people would not come to the door when she knocked she must make them do no. Police-constable Heath corroborated an to the prieoner presenting a pistol at the complainant.

Stables, Knightsbridge, appeared at the Hammersmith Police-court, to answer a summons charging her with publishing a defamatory libel concerning John Henrys Stuart Reid, Quartermaster of the First Life Guards. Mr. Harris appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Edward Lewis for the defendant, who was allowed to sit at the solicitors' table. Mr. Harris, in his opening statement, said that some time ago, up to June, 1875, the complainant and the defendant were on amicable terms. Subsequently the complainant married, which seemed to have aroused ill-feeling, and since then he had been subjected to a system of persecution. He believed the defendant was married, but she went in her maiden name. Mr. Bridge: She is Miss Reynolds as far as the public is concerned. Mr. Harris said she was. The first occasion of corn plainant hearing of the course of conduct the defendant was pursuing was in consequence of a letter which his wife received. It referred to an advertisement which the defendant attempted to insert in I the Times, and in consequence of its objectionable character they refused to publish without consulting Mrs. Reid. After that she met the complainant and his wife, and assaulted the latter. Mr. Lewis objected to going into matters which did not refer to the libel. 1 Mr. Harris said his object was to show malice. He I then referred to three letters addressed to officers in the Life Guards, in which the defendant, was alleged to imply that the complainant had been guilty of unnatural offences. After proof of handwritinghad been given, Mr. Lewis asked for an adjournment, as he attended in perfect ignorance of the charge. Mr. Bridge then adjourned the summons until the 23rd inst.  KRUPP .

Diekeneagainet.young Pannell student, 1%41 Bayart,' that the latter orfor.,d hiin .E5OO to kill Monsieur and Madante Bnyart, at Roubaix, France, the parents of the defendant, was reamed at the Town Hall, Hertford, before a full bench of magistrate.. The cogrt wan densely crowded. Mr. Montague Willianm prosecutod ; Mr. Poland defended.  . _ _ .... Several wltnesses having been re-called that had been previously examined, A clerk in the Stamp Omen proved the purchase by ' Dickens of a 95., bill stamped, on the 14th August. John Roney, a solicitor's clerk, proved going to Roubaix, and following the route alleged to have been deseribed and written by the defendant, and handed ' by him to the prosecutor, he arrived at the house or the defendant's father.  This closed the case for the prosecution. , The defendant was then cautioned in the usual way, and in reply to the question whether he had anything to my, said, ""I am not guilty."" Mr. Poland, addressing the magistrates on behalf of the defendant, characterised the case son very remarkable one and having alluded to the serimm character of the charge against his client, asked the Bench whether, after what they bad men of the demeanour of the prosecutor, they really believed that there was anything in the accusation, and whether it was not made abundantly apparent that the whole' story was concocted by Dickens from motives of ex,' tertion. The learned gentleman ridiculed the idea Of the conversations alleged to have taken place as tolhe best way of poisoning steel and no forth, anti described them as a ttseue of inventions. He also calla/ attention to the remarkable manner in which the prosecutor had managed to obtain confirmatory evidence just at those points where he required it. First of all, there was the singular fact that Mrs: Moran should have gone into Dickenis bedroom just at the moment the photographs of the defendant's parents were lying on the table; and, then, again, it was somewhat reInarkable that several of the confirmatory witnesses were strongly hostile to the Rev. Father Stanfield, with whom the defendant was living. The next important matter to have confirmation upon was the suggestion that the defendant had signed- the note of hand for :two. and in this instance also the confirmatory witnees turned spin the person of the landlord of the "" Vine,"" just no the defendant was writing on a !Meet of paper, which it was suggested was the bill in question. The defendant's reply was that that bill and its endorsement had been forged by Dickens. Was it likely that a man who was about to sign the death -warrant of his prents would have chosen such an occasion, and have done the not in the presence of a third person? A. to the letter supposed to have been left at the 't Vine,"" the suggestion of the defendant was that Dickens had asked him to give him a route to Italy, and that this route was written by Bayart and left for Dickens at the ""Vine,"" this being all that the envelope contained. But here again some confirmation of Dickene's evidence was deemed essential, and so Dickens, after producing a letter that was !suggested as being the one brought from the "" Vine,"" got his friends, Mr. Cobham and Mr. Moran, to sign it sta having been opened in their presence. The story as to how the £lO was provided, and the fact that that sum had been given to Dickens at all, he characterised al absurd, alleging that Dickens knew that the money Bayart was getting together at the time was wanted for the young lady with whom he was in correspondence abroad, but he had purposely twisted the facts so as to make them fit in with his own suggestion. In conclusion the learned counsel asked the magistrates if they were satisfied that the charge had not been made out,, and not to shrink from doing their duty by dismissing the case.  Florim-ond Bayart, of Roubaix, France, brother of the accused, extunined, etated that the words, ""Good ! for £soo.—Heriford, April 10, 1878.—Paul Bayart,"" were not in hie brother Paul's handwriting. It was English writing. The plan produced (purporting to show the route from the station to M. Bayart's house) contained the words "" Floriniond Nattel."" They were not in the defendant's writing. ""No. M"" on the plan was exactly on the spot occupied by No. 52. The word ""Nattel,"" as written, ought to be ""Wattel."" The door of the house where witness lived was at the side, but on the plan it was in the centre. The little street marked "" lane"" on the plan was not known, and the writing was not that of the defendant. The instructions in the red book were not in the defendant's handwriting; the hand was the came as that of the writing on the plan. There were two postal deliveries—one at 8 0 a.in. and the other at 5.30 or 7.0 in the evening. Remembered seeing the letter produced. Witness opened it. (This was the letter from Dickens to M. 13ayart, senior.) On the name day he received the telegram produced. It wee thus worded : ""Roubaix from Hertford—My letter is useless. Affair in hands of police. Dickens, Hertford, 10.45. To Bayart, Roubaix."" Before that was received Achille Bayart had started for England.. 1 . .

That on the envelope of the letter left at the "" Vine"" was.  Paul Henneon, clerk to an avocet at Tourcohim, was also examined. He said he had known the defendant since 1872, and had studied with him for the law. Knew his handwriting, and corroborated the two previous witnesses as to the signature to the bill and the writing on the plan and red book not being that of the defendant.  The Rev. Father Stanfield mid he believed the writing on the bill wan not the defendant's. I This was the case for the defence. Mr. Montague Williams then addressed the Bench in reply, urging that the evidence he had adduced was sufficient to entitle him to ask for the committal of the accused. He rebutted the counter charge made against the prosecutor that this was an attempt to extort money by the argument that, if he had any wish to obtain money he would never have gone to the police at all, but, having all his plane laid and his schemes concocted, he would have brought his artillery to bear upon the person whom he hoped to victiMISe.  The prisoner was committed for trial at the next assizes. Bail was accepted for his appearance. The Rev. Father Stanfield and Mr. W. Pollard being the two sureties in £ll3O each, and the defendant himself was bound over in .e2OO. "

The Lady's Magazine nays (in speaking of velveteen, which is to be very fashionable as the autumn and winter advance) ""The autumn tints of foliage are reflected in the rich reds, greens, and browns which art among the most effective and most fashionable shades of velveteen. A variety of green, grey, ' and ruby shades, together with lovely mauves, pinks, creams, and blues for evening wear, provides a selection of colouring which most meet the tastes of all. More than one make of velveteen is beautiful in quality, rich and sheeny of surface, and fast pile. Such velveteen makes elegant smocks and frocks for girls of all ages. It will be in request this autumn for smart little coats and vetements trimmed with fur.""  COMFORT)  ArTrrlN  Here we have a drew, of dark red crepe cloth with rich jet collar and lace and jet bodice and a eimilar trimming at the bottom of the dress. A large creamcoloured bow, tied at the throat, should be worn with this. _ . ,  Bodice fronts cut in the corselet shape (oheerveean authority on Paris fashions, writing in the Daily Telegraph) are sometimes combined with plain high backe, or with backs arranged in Watteau pleats if the robe is intended to be worn in the house. Here is an instance. The skirt. fashioned closely in statueame fashion, and the Watteau pleated train are of pearl-grey faille, and the chemisette and sleeves of white sumh ; whereas the side* and low front of the bodice are covered with rich arabesques of grey and white passementerie interwoven with silver. Gauntlet cuffs of the same handsome work complete the sleeves, the inevitable round necklet to which the chemisette is gathered being also made to correspond. Another fashionable bodice is the cuirase, namely, a tight-fitting bodice reaching a little below the waist, applicable to high gowns and to low evening dresses. They are eometimee laced or buttoned at the back, or ' may be--if high—open in a point in front to show a plastron or full drapery of another material. It is ' thus with a heliotrope cloth gown, the open edges of , the bodice being trimmed with bands of jet trhaming framing in a drapery of heliotrope stash. Another broader band of jet appears on the hem of the skirt. Thu lower edge of a cuirass bodice may be concealed beneath a folded ribbon which lies below the line of the waist. Chaeed metal belts are also worn in this way, the style which obtains for them being the Burden with polished stones set here and there on the pointed claim. In choosing a new costume it is neceeeary first to decide whether the said costume is to do duty all through the winter or whether it only needed for the autumn months. In the former ease a much darker colour most be chosen, whereas in . the second a lighter one would be • prekrabla Fashion patroniees light colours this 11.600,  and it is curious to note what a large majority of relatively pale tones are to be seen in the shop windows, and how bright and gay they look in consequence. The decision in the matter of colour must also depend on the nature of the winter outer garment to be worn ; the owner or would-be purcbseer of a long mantle or pelisse is pretty free to indulge in any of the new and fashionable light tints she lists, since the oostume may be hidden for out of doors, and indoors—at home as well as in other peoples houses--quite light colours will be permissible.  .$4 tlt4 1 7/ A ipo. v  tfiz c.,00 / r 1 'R.,, t •- I ;111 /OP i 7' 0 .

Bowyer was a person who went to Crewe some nine or ten years ago, and there set up in a small business as hair dreseer. By the year 1380 he seemed to hove involved himself in very considerable diflibulties. Between 1880 and 1883 some 12 war• rants were served upon him for debts reaching a total of £260. Not one penny was over recovered, because there were uo goods to levy upon. The articlea at Bowyer's so celled place of bust ness were all ""durnmies."" Between the beginning of 1883 and May, 1881, nu less than 75 executions : were served upon Bowyer. In February, 1884, he was taken to Kuutsford under no less than nine county court warrants. He came out in April, 1884, and immediately resumed business. Mr. Marehall proceeded to relate the different transactions into which Bowyer entered,Mscribing Cite modus pperandi adopted. When, in ordering goods for the first time, he we asked for a reference, he referred the parties to the other prisoners sod Willer, who wrote flattering testimonials.

Grosfield has addreased the following letter to Mr. T. Woolfenden, Denton, with reference to his candidature for the Orton division of South-esat Lancashits  June 3, 1885.  Dear Mr. Woolfenclem—To you, as chairman of the onetime at which I was invited to become the Liberal candidate for the Gorton division of South east Lancashire, I respectfully address mv reply, sending at the same time a copy to our president, Mr George Clay. My letter would not need to be elaborate if it were inteuded only for the Council and the constituency of the Gortou Division, bat our yroceedines have at tracted the attention of a large circle of Liberals who are iiiielested in tL• honour and the discipline of their party, and for their sake I will con Miley state the facts of the case With the concurrence of existing Liberal or• gauiseeions, and by continuation of public meet tugs, the conetitufion of our Council was settled upon • broad and proportionate basis of represen tation, and 217 membeas were elected with the utmost publicity, delabesetion, and fairness. At the first meeting of the Council an ""Order of Procedure,"" which lad been acted upon in another diensiou, was unsuimously adopted, providing for the orderly nomination ot candidates and tot the elimination of those who obtaiueel the small, r number of voter; and it was assumed that the Out who should finally receive the largest wee would be the accepted candidate. Iu the first voting I had a cleat nnejoeity of the pees me present, siud iii the final vote I had te u WI de if the rotating in thy favour. The friends of Mr. Richard Peactck had given hint thirteen votes at the first meeting; ot the Betend wee, ing they vainly endeavoured to force his mune upon the Council; and now for a thi,d tithe hey urge that a deputation should be eon to hint to dis cover whether he sore a Liberal or no the inference being that if he could +(peat the articles of the Libre al creed, ex animo or °the mime, the COnnell would welcome him aeon angel who had been amongst us unaware s. At the cle Se of four-hours' sitting, end a lien many menet:wee had retired, it was moved that I should be the adopted candidate, and an amendment was made for ad. jourunaent with the view of sending a deputation to Mr. Peacock, which amendment received 48 vote, whilst 59 votes were recorded in my favour. I could not accept so uncertain a call, and 1 eought an interview with each section of the Council, and obtained • vole by ballot which gave 100 ie my favour and 28 against but the force of this vote woe weakened by tin abseuse of 80 members. I there- mein issued a circular to each member of the Council, luelting en ex preseason of opinion by post card to an official in each section, with the following result :  . Favour- Uniavour able, able. No reply Gorton 75 l 6  Opensbaw 55  2. 4  Dnuton and liaugbtuo 28 ll  Mr. Peacock's friends now admit that it is hopeless to obtain a vole:of the Council in big favour, and they only ask that L should retire upon my laureleand allow the introduction of a ""strong candidate,"" • term the meaning of which I do not understand, though I thiuk it &gni& a a candidate whese father or brother might reflect sufficient lustre upon him to make it, dull person peas for brilliant. Meanwhile I should meekly wander forth into the wilderness as a scapegoat, bearing hot my own sine bct the sins of a aeon of quasi-Liberals. This may he good discipline for me, but I should thereby do irreparable injury to the Liberal party in this division, I now aunt tome to you my acceptance of the invitation of the Council. Having mode this decision, I shall maintain it by going to the poll, no matter who takes the field. I know well the character of the electors of this division. I shall rotor the hats with a brave heart and • living faith in those principles which have crowned our past history with true glory, and which will make the future of our people lie of complete freedom and widespnad prosperity and peace.

She had wished most earnestly to le lett in peace in the little home made sacred IM her by the memories of her husband; but the premium put upon her by both father apd mother, together with considerations of ecosomy, had prevailed in the end. So sumo AMB isfs after Raymond's departuro, she found Plowlf installed, as if her short married life ,had been but a dream, in that dull, damp NIOSIDO by the roadside where she had been olicretght sp. It. garden was unkempt, it. oral's grimy; the inside was dirty and neglected. Most of the furniture was broken. dusty, and ink-stained. For the greater part of the day the half-pay Colonel eat grumbling in his smoking-room. which waa the gloomiest 'apartment in that gloomy house. Ile had no occupation now, and not the best of tempers. . The mother looked careworn and ill, and her . gowns were nearly as dirty as the chintz on Abe drawing-room sofa. The two elder girls, iwho were certainly growing very pretty, like ~ nix, seemed to her noisy and ill-bred when their parents' eyes were not upon them. The younger children were fretful and cross, and two at least among them, delicate and under. There was hardly a chair in the house four sound legs, not a tabk-cloth that was y perforated with holes, not a dish that was supped.

An uatidy maid-servant led him through the passage, which smelt of bad tobacco, out on to a plot of dry gram surrounded by a bodge and • few overgrown shrubs. On a bench by one of these. Mrs. Joliffe was sitting. Sir Paul noticed how terribly thin she looked in her *see tight -fitting lilac cotton dress. But to IMo—theme& who had yearned in a way which 'almost made him smile at himself, to look upon her fee, again—she was lovelier than ever. The evening sun lit up her masses of Veld hair, her swan-like white throat, and the limy little ear, unadorned, like her heads and .erneta, with any jewel. Her eyes shone, too, as she reenguissd her kind old friend. She woe so pleased to see him, that she forgot to , blush for the untidiness and gloom of her lather's Immo. • The General seated himself on the bench : beside her.

He told us that he had brought with him a tame Puma, end *though it used to live in hi, liouse sod lie on his study hearthrng like • very nice putey cOt ; he did not find that it adapted itself well to English we a and English fif .e, or at all events Englishe did not seem to take to it, so as preurted ithle beast to the Zoological Gardens, felt himself very ill used, beau° the keeper, this, objected to his climbing over the barrier in Vie oocesiosui of his visits to hie savage lathing not, and resealing it through the bus. We went t see the animal the other dav in the cure with two others of its species, anti felt no desire to trust ourselves or our hands to its blincfiehments, and thcogh perhaps the keepers were quite richt to forbid our clerical friend from indulging ir the intimocy be sought to renew with his 'ormer jut. I was very sorry to See on the occasion of my recent visit to the gardens that the old polar bear is dying, and may be dead by this time, fv h itail eaten nothing kr more than a week. It w-. 4 quite touching to see the change that has come over the pier fellow. He now ma ecarcely crawl, and walks with a dejected appearanos or %do m a very lugubrious attitude, watching the sidle of his yomiger companion, who frisks about S 4 if by way of contrast, stopping occaeionally in his walks, to look it, uid apparently to pity, his miserable old .friend.  This poor fellow in twentyaeven years of age. Ho war )rerouted to the gardens by my friend Mr. Leigh Smith, OA Arctic explorer. in 1870, being then about three year' of age. This was, oi comae, before the later expeditions' were taken by Mr. Leigh Smith through the icy seas, in his own vessel the ""Eire,"" of 360 tons burden, 125 ft. long by 25ft., bon. fitted out with every poesible equipment for the voyage, and with • gallant band of 2$ souls ready for Nerves, with Mr. Leigh Smith at the head. Many bears were shot and some taken alive on this voyage to Franz Josefland, and the description of their capture is meet interesting. But our poor old Polar bear, whose decadence ws are now deploring, was an inhabitant of the Zoological Gardens long before the Eire went on her first voyage, so that he has attained something like old age for one of his species. Ira coat has lost it, whiteness anti is now yellow and diecoloured, for he has not been able to attend to his toilette ad metal for some weeks. Doubtlose we shall hear of hie death before this is printed, and that is one of the drawbacks to lankier a personal neouaintance with any of the animals in them gardens, their mortality is an rreat, for indeed their conditions are for removed front those for which Nature intended them. The only °Desolation is to be found in the thought that they would probably have perished long ago through Arms of circumstances if left in their native WOMIaI and forests, or their sandy plains or fmaen seas, for Nature does not protect them from accident or disaster in any memure. I have had a very magnificently adorned number of a periodical Pent to Me called the ""Salon,"" and thiti number, which has a gorgeous front page. is called the ""Ambassadorial number,"" and contains portrait"" sad biographies of Arnbernedore, Minister,. and Chem& Affaires accredited te the Court of St. Jamee'. There are ere the national anthems given of nearly all the countries mentioned, and a definition of universal pea4s written v and signed by each Ambaseador. with • peaceful"" intro& otion by the Editor. The Italian Ambassador save that ""Diplomacy exerts for the sake of peace,"" which sentiment is really the pervading epirit of the whol, publication, which may be said to, be in truth a protest in favour of peace. Sir Joseph Peace is. as ire all know, the prem. deet of the Peace Society, and he writes a miry sensible intoduction to the volume, saying that ""Peace is the realier tion of Altman brotherhood. The solidarity of the race is an unquestionable fact. National inters*, are mutual, liberty, free institutions, and popular rights are the growth, not of war, but of peace. One century of unbroken universal peace would do mere for the world in these respects than five thousand yearn of blood have done. Peace in the nese of freedom and of all its glorious institutions wfierese war haa ever been the chief enslaver of mankind."" An appropriate and very excellent likened' of Queen VictSria in • very becoming dress of black satin and the richest lace. wearing her parreet, is the first of the portraits given with the muse and words of the National Anthem on the commits 111.1f(8. Then his Exeellency F. F. Bayard. the Lnited States Ambaseridor, with his mem* on the greet subject of peace, clearly expremed, and signed by himself beneath his portrait, and the National American Hymn is also given. Hie Excellency M. De Steel is the Rosh° Aminosaaar. and his countenance is • pleasing one, which comae after the Ruseian National Hymn; which as • pianist I mem to master and play it too. Count Hateoldt. the German Ambaasador, is a characteristic, diplomatM: indeed, all the portraits gives are pleasing and ettereeting, and we seem as if we cou'd trace their national features, as we read tlier special""boo mots"" on the great eubject on which their opinions have been sought. The Portestleßo Minister. M, de Soveml, says ""there are large and small countries: men have everywhere the same stature."" The Belgian Minister, Baron Whetnell. tette tie that ""Peace is the greatest blowsier in this world. Everybody agrees on this rubject in principle. but not so in practice."" The Chine.* and the Japanese Ministers come next, and we can hut contrast the action of their respective onantrier, which are at thin moment tearing melt other to pieces, with their peaceful de&Antic:is and protestations that ""Peace is the Mterest paramount of nations."" Tung Ta Jen, the Chinese durnitsry, is decimated with the peacock feather, and wears a button of the first rank, so that we are bound to look upon him with respect —though hie position DOI in the midst of blood.hed. wm, and treachery must be very trying te so peacefully inclined • representative as he seem, to be. The whole ambassadorial group ol faces lamented in this elegantly got up vaulter of the Salon is very suggestive and attracOve and the sentiments exprmeed by each and Pirated by them are such as Sir Joseph Pease mit highly approve, even to those of the dusky Haitian Charge d'Aff•irs, Louis Joseph Janvier, who says that' ""peace is the only essential condition foe the civilisation of nation' and races."" Well 1 all these distinguished individuate are said to be accredited to the Court of St. James, and we who hear the form of speech naturally ask, ""Why 3t. Imes ?"" . . . - . . .  A little to the Wert as St James's is, it is yet oontiguoua to the bustle and hum of the City, but it only dates u • place for State ceremesials from the time of William 111. In fact, it was not until the burning of Whitehall that this sad and sombre brick building was recognised as a place wherein tO conduct state function*. A memorial of St. Jamee's 1)elsos has lately been written by one of the sub-deans of her Majesty's (lapels Royal, Mr. Edgar Shepherd, and I hue hem reacliog it with pleasure' for he engrafts WWI very curious incidents of his hiatus-eel, account of the old palace. It appears that no English monarch between Henry VIII. and William lIL eyes took up. regular abode at St. James Henry VIII. first toads a palace out of the dingy old building, and for centuries before that time it we. used sea leper house intended for the reception of fourteen leprous Meters, who were to live • *devout life, ""living chastity and honestly in Divine service.* The resecin for playslug this.

The tower and gateway were added to oy Charles 11., who planted trees, laid down broad gruel walks, aud formed the aviary from which the ""Birdcage walk"" took its name.

The old State rooms are well worth seeing for the rake of the artist, Sir Christopher Wren, who designed ' relation their inouldiugs and cornices. The prom& . of our Queen Victoria, June art, 1837, took ""thee in St. Jamesth Palace and as she stood in the window on that eventful occasion looking pale and anxioua, she wae deemed in dcep mourning, with a white tipit, white cuff., and a border of white lace under a small black bonnet, which was placed far bark on her head, exhibiting her fair hair, simply parted in front over her forehead. Wheu kle proclamation was over, and the multitude! were cheering, the young Queen threw her arms round her mother and wept without restraint. Marriages, chrietenings, and eieaths are recorded in the annals of the Royal Chapel, St. James'. else laet regieter being that of the marriage betweee Prince Geage and the l'rineess May.

I was unlucky enough to go to that theartre to me for the second time the "" Maequerades "" en the very evening when Mr. George Alexander fell ill of measles, from which malady he is still sufferjar, and is unable to take his part in the ',Wormance.

Her place is taken at St. Janie' by lilies Evelyn Millard, who is an excellent and sympathetic actress, and a very charming nod pretty woman, and iummuch as she is more refined and less demonstrative than her predecessor is, I think, a great gain to Mr. Almeader's time pithy. I hal the greet pleasure of hearing Josef lirof-71.11:1 play inn the piano at the beginning of this eerie. He gave this, his only recital, on one of ltesinstein's beautiful grand planet at St. James' Hall. I bad almost called him little Hofmann for it is eight years Linen I heard him, and he is now no longer ""little Hofmann,"" as he was then. at ten year, old, in a sailor suit, but he is grail.. ally ithmosehing num'a estate, and yet he has het DODe of the pleasant boyish expression he had then, which is so attractive now. When Rubensteiu was asked his opinion of youthful prodigies in his own art, forgetting his own case, for he replied, when he was only eight years old, he shook hie leonine head, sad said, ""I have no faith in them, they promise much. bot always disappoint our expectations. One exception only min I make and that is in favour of a httle boy whom I heard play the ether day, in Varsowie—his name is Joel Hofmann."" A. little later in the summer of 1887. little Hofmann, then ten years old, made bie first bow to an English audience at a concert given under the direction of Mr. Vert. Several connoisseure were present at this concert, whose opinion was most favourable, and immediately it W 24 noised abroad that a second Miami had I come to delight the English 'nude lovers. H. mu a dear little, unaffected fellow then, aa he is now, though a strapping lad of seventeen. He hae a good hocked fee, full of youthful enthusiasm, and when hie really beautiful playing is commended and hue audience expresses its feeling by cheers, his face beams all over with pleasure, and he is evidently much delighted; but there,. 3104 a bit of self-conscionmese or vanity about him. When he was quite young he gave fifty coneerta in America, but the fatigue of travel and the excitement of repeated publie appearances caused his health to fail somewhat, and hie parents wisely de-ermined to return to Europe, and to devote the means obtained by the concerts to the boy's study and edueation, and not to allow him to appear in nubile again till hie health was fully established and his studies had advanned to a satiathotory issue. His one aspiration was to become a pupil of the great penis* Rubenstein, whom he idolised, and upon hearth!' lam play again the great maker iconeented to direct his studies. Twice a week the lad journeyed to Dresden, where Ruhansteth resided, and a time of deep study sad madam work followed. After two years and a half of earned work and devotion to his master Jowl Hoffman wee declared by his teeither to be ready to re-appear before the world and to peove liimaelf worthy of his early promise and • credit to his master. Rubenstein had shown how deeply attached he was to the youth, and at times whea performing in publio his swathes was rewarded by stormy applause, and he might be recalled over and over agate, Rubenstein was so mewed that he embrassed and kissed his young pupil. His performarice on Monday last was wouderful, and his rendering of some of the mod debases, as well aa the most powerful, passages was wonderful, so that a large audience ma. 421110ai taken by ft:prim and the cheering was enornioue. He played specimens of the writhe of Mendelmohn, Weber, Chocks, and Lists, the latter by special raved and very charmingly, but the work of Ida great maker, Rubenetein, seemed to give him more pleasure than all the mt. for when he gave, for the Seat time, a Polonaise written by Rubenstein, and dediestql to himself, and a Gavotte, which evoked boisterous acclamation, he turned his youthful fare with a nested smile on his audience, ail lie bowed low to them, and eeemed fully to appreciate the encouragement given to him on all aides.. Of eouree, he played on a Bechstein piano, and he is persistent in his admiratioa of these beautiful iasteumente at all times. He says that ""they possess !reader poetry of tone, and resemble the human voice more than any Mlle!' instrument. It is the methadon of ray idea of a piano, and the only one. on whirls I can express all I feel."" Whilst I am writing these lines there mimes to me the sad news of- Anton Rubeestein's redden death at Peterhof!, near St. reterthurg. It has taken everyone by surprise, and lovers of music are in great dietree. for to them his Ines is irreparable. My thoughts isimediately went 'to the interesting youth whom I had so lately seen and heard. and whcee affections ma well ea his proles. aional interests. were bound up with 'Rubenstein. How sad he will be now but it is possible that, after all. Hoffmann may be his treat maker's euccemor, and that hi neintle may truly have fallen in three last hour. upon hie shoulders. He, too, was a youthful prodigy, for he Dlaall his first bow to the public whim be was but eight yeses old, and Ins later years were marked, as we all know, by an unprecedented. succemion of artistic, triumphs. To hear Rubenstein was to listen to playing that divine. Its force was maddening—everyone felt that they were in the presence of an inspired genius, and that was all that could be realised for the moment. He was born is November, 1830, so that he was just 64 years of age when he played his lak note, or wrote his last bar of adorable memo. Hi. lose oilmen suoh a gap as was canoed in recent years by the deaths of Meadelmohn. Chopin Wagner. or Lists. and it is hard to realise, in art as in all elm, ""one generation pameth away and another geneustion cornetts."" but MO it is. and when most  He seemed to stand between my soul and.hesven, Ilion came the thunderbolt. 'Tie ever thin! And the unquiet anil foreboding sense That thus 'twill ever be, cloth lsl,k itoeW Darkly with all deep love! He died!"" Whilst thinking than, we are reminded of line, no appropriate to the genius of our lost master, written by Pope, our own great poet.

These teams met at Park-road I:orth, and as the lordly Laird's were anxious to shake off the troubles of the previous week a close game was in prospect. The County match next door was the all important fixture of the day, and the Camels gate was depleted accordingly. Then, again there was the long list of reverses which both clubs had sustained, and of course interest had lagged through cause and effect. The ground was in good condition when the teams appeared, and the drainage system, together with the dry atmosphere had hardened the surface considerably. Of the football there was not much 'brilliance, but in the first half the Camels got a goal which bore them to victory. In the second half Mold made several fine raids, but although. many of the two hundred spectators considered that the Welshmen deserved a point the necessary goal waa not forthcoming, and the end saw the Laird's winners by a goal to nothing.

The morning opened inauspiciously, and a thunderstorm passed over the ground, until noon, when the weather cleared up, and a splendid summer's afternoon favoured the finish.. The Birkenhead men had lost four wickets on Friday evening for 15 runs, and on Saimaa:4 the innings concluded for 68 which left the Manchester men 51 to get to win. This they did with th., assistance of Messrs. E. B. Rowley and C.G.

It was not necessary .to get off the parapet by the tree new' to the Punch Bowl Inn. but a little further on it was necessary to step into the road owing to the fact that one end of the, launch Bowl alone was just ten inches off the edge of the parapet. As for the tree near the Iff'eeleyan Chapel there was room for three aleople to walk abreast there. He respecthilly asked that the minute should be referred. back.  ;Captainilening said he had been put to considerable inconvenience by these trees, and wrged that. they ahould be removed.

This formed the title of the subject from which the Bev. H. J. Bryan addressed the monthly gathering of men at St. Mary's Church on Sunday afternoon. He said it is unneomeary for use to remind you that the primary reference of our *object is to Birkenhead, which, in the 'mere hopeful past, aspired to and anticipated the greatnem and the glory, and the &vie honours of a great cety. I do not know whether it leas so titled ironically, nor wheelies the commendable Aspirations end expectations whieh the title implies find any 2404 place in the heart of the 'borough to-day; but this I do know, that the Birkenheed of the present is far superior to test of the past. And when the competition of her more wealthy neighbour is taken into consideration, there is much cease for congratulation on the scams and progress observable. But there is greet room for improvement. Much reIretille to be cluan and indeed, undone are Birkenhead realises the envielde distinction of a ""City present."" But perhaps the unrealised ideal will act as a stimulus and attraction te pursue a course of procedure that will ultimately assure the desired goal. But be this as it may. it will be readily coneeded that it-is much better to be ""the city ef the future"" than of the past. A Yew things have struck me very forcibly in in perambulations through the borough, which I think raight well occupy the legislative caymans of the powers that be. And I am gong to speak my mind pretty freely shoat them too.—(e) Can anyone say that the liquor traffic of this town is all that can be desired or 'yen approaching to it? Will anyone for a moment plead the necessity for the mistence of all the facilities for drink , which abound? Can any logic whatever justify the existence and continuance of this fruitful source of evil in our midst? Mark you, I am not speaking of total eholition. but of alumni:Aeon of Oupply. The freettot victims in their most lucid moments confess as well as the most thoughtful of otth that they would =Mica to ese the evil minimised if it cannot be removed. And as a man intended only in the well-being of my fellow-11:61e I coneem frankly and feerlesely that it is my greateet opponent, as well as the greeted enemy of moven, material, moral, social, and civic A speaker at a recent meeting of the Licensed Victuallers' Almelo. tion in Liverpool, complained that Tehlwince reformers do not go into the shuns and courts to inquire into the real ;came of misery and poverty. Ido not know whether his conscience the pricking him, I sincerely hope it wee; but to his bold etatement I Iwply that many have done, and their conielnsions have been unanimous ""that it is the drink that does it."" And I noliesitatingly assert, after newly ten years' experience of ministerial work in three different perishes. that it is the seamy of humanity, morality, said religion, of progress, prosperity, and lieipmese, end mils loudly for remedial le' etion. (b) I turn now to our crowded tinge A diflioult problem I confine, but it finely admits) Of great improvement. What sort of citizens can such dwellings turn out? What a prejudicial effect they meet have op the physique of the rising generation? What ideas can they have of morels? Hew frightfully handicapped they must be in the great conflict of life. My very soul sympathises with them. They I seem so helpless from actual sin, the eon. sequenoe in the majority of cases of heredity; that they despair of ever attaining to a life of purity and happiness, and in thie state of mind and feeling they eke out their miserekle existanoes. Low rates of wages for unskilled labour, early and foolish mar_ lieges inexperience and want of economy, and d;-ink withal account for a good deal of this state of things. And I think I may say with all safety that an effectual remedy for a greet deal fit would be found in less laziness, more manliness, a judicious use of Sunlight soap, a little less use 0( the lug, and a more efficient. compulsory, if you like, system of inspection.--(c) There is the pernicious and degrading system of Sunday trading, which seems to be beneath the dignity of our legislators to notice, but whidli by its permiseien in the streets and shops ' is destroying the distinction which marks the seventh day from the other six, and is endangering its existence as a day of eit. Six days are not sufficient to utilise in money-making and money-epending, but , men must steal the seventh day, and rob God of what is peculiarly Ilia oun. Are tlic individuals the better? Is the Borough? No. How can a thief hope to prosper? And the eider and abetter is equally guilty. I dermay my_ words will have little weight, but, -notwithstanding, I must unburden my , conscience, and lay the megonsebility upon the moral conscience of this town, of ithich you men form a part.—.(d) I am reminded fuither 'of the (Peelle -long hours of ahemsaistants. Put what has that to do with me? I hear somebody say. Yes, it has a good deal to do with you. Take your week's wages home in proper time, and. let your wife do her shopping in proper time, and that will be something towards a remedy. I I was thankful to read the other day the remarks of the /medical officer a health in reference to the long hours of barmaids, and I fully endorse his wise and timely remarks. I hope the day is not far distant when this matter will receive the attention it Ovary's. The greedy, grasping spirit of commercialism, the insatiable greed for gold. which seems to be on the increase, will have much to answer for to the Judge of all mankind for the suffering and degradation it has been largely instrumental ineroducing.—(e) There is one other matter which I dare not peas over in silence. The horrible spectacles , which meet our eyes on the public hoardings of the borough are no croM to our pub-lie morals. The immorally, ruggeetive and blood-curdling pictures which our ohildren and youths have conetantly to behold meet of necessity have a prejudicial effect upon their impressiouable natures. I have a child of my own, lAD, in his innocency, wants to know what it all means. He sometimes corms home terrified, and tries to explain whee horrible things he saw men doing in the pictures. I bell him to talents notice, but he cannot help it. And our children, , who are to be the men of the future, be, ecme accustomed to such seemingly cruel , deeds, and are in danger of losing their ' gelato dispogtion, and their sympathetic neiturs. of graving up loveless, and eruel, and callous. Is this nothing to be concerned about? At the Woodeide we find an rietomatic machine, about which, the less said the better. The specimens of art, no, it is a libel on the profession, which are there exhibits), are a disgrace to the morality at the com.saunity. Woe to the man -who- thus trades upon the morals of hie fellows for the sake of filthy lucre. But lam thankful to my we can turn our attention to a ""City Future"" whose builder and maker is Go& wherein dwelleth righteousness. There, it is not the ""survival of the fittest,"" nor yet of the etrongest, but of the true faithful follower of his Lord and Matter. Bat this is a prepared city for a prepared people. And whatever be our secret hopes of entering here, let me say plainly that cities:whip therein depends entirely upon gar condnot Leo and now. He wise neglects, repots, and forgets God will never enter there. There the drunkard would never be haesee. for there are no dtrinkshcps there. ""No drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God."" Men sell their heaven and their sold to the devil when they give themselves over to strong think. And then men wonder why we. WOkt.. snob ado about the question of drink- 'Phi. ""City Of the Future"" has no *hutches. I think I hear some man say ""And a good thing too."" I have no doubt some would be much relieved. They would uot then perhaps be reminded that there I, a God, whose love and mem they ere outraging, that they hare a conscience and a wear dries soul be save and fit for the sky.

THE baptism of a Cingalesc child with full Buddhist rites took place last week before 50,000 Parisians collveted ill the Jardin d'Aeclimitation. where the Cingale:w troupe are now exhibiting. The proceedings began in the morning by a visit of two priests to the cradle, where. according to precedent, they drew the child's horoscope, to the effect that he would reach a great old age, and have many children. In the afternoon the women at a given signal walked out of their huts chanting a wild refrain, and carried a bag containing a sacred tooth of Sakyn Mouni to where the infant lay on the grass. They there scattered flowers over it, while the men took up the song. The child has received, besides the name of its father, the additional one of Paris. "

To him it was a pleasure to be interested in The work of God, and hoped the day was far distant when he would sever Iris connection with the church. Great credit is due to Masers T. Phillips and D.

A few friends connected with the Methodist Chapel also presented Mr Harris with a metronome aa a slight then of their esteem, and for the help which he has always been most ready to give them.

At the Highgate Police Court, London, Mary E. Hurst, an elderly lady, of 3, Adelaide Terrace, Itlyddelton Road, Hornsey, has been summoned for keeping three dogs without licenses.—Police-inspector John Bullock said in consequence of a complaint received from the defendant of sonic boys having broken her windows, he visited her house, and directly the door was opened a number of dugs rushed out. lb e asked Mrs. Hurst how nisrny dogs she had, and she produced four licenses, but Ire had already seen seven dogs, and from the obnoxious odour that descended from the upper part of the house, he believed there must be some inure in the plsce, and he went upstairs to satisfy bine:elf. He had scarcely reached the top of the sticks when four other dogs came running out and barking in such a feiocious manner that he had to run behind the defendant for pretection. Oil going into the room the dogs licei come from, he found it in a most filthy state.—Tbe defendant said it was quite correct that she had the dogs when the inspector called, but seven of then' were pundes born in the house, and had never been out of it, and but for her sending to complain of having her windows broken, the inspector would never have knee n she had them at all. (Laughter) —Mr. Bodkin Najd it did not matter whether the dogs had born kept. in the house or not, she was bound to have license for them. The defendant said she was not :cadre of this, but she had since got rid of them Bodkin told her she was liable to a tine of £5 for each dog.

On this occasion Impeder Sinclair (Edenfielifi, Tether to the Chief Constable of Accrington, beat his opponent no did also P.S. Briggs. and P.C.'s Walton and Whittle. Supt.

Jump proposed the health of the Accrington Borough Police and the bowling team, expressing the great pleasure felt in meeting them on the bowling green, and satisfac. that at the fine afternoon. Such meetings were new to him, but he felt sure from hiat visit to Accrington and the harmonay and the hearty feeling which had been witnessed during the games that al tertioon, that such gatherings did the forces good, as it created brotherly feeling and a 'MOM intimate acquaintance among the men. (Hear, hear.) He hoped that co long as be wee with them in that division that these annual meets would be maintained, and that the mutual esteem between the Ressenclalo and Accrington police would ho maintained. (Applause.) The toast was drunk with musical honoure, coupled with the name of Chief Constable Sinclair. In responding. Mr. Sinclair alluded to the first meeting of the county and borough men, it being first in cricket, but three years ago it was changed to bowling, in which more men could engage in the pleasant pastime. There had been three changes of superintendents in the Rossendale division in as many years, and he did hope that Sept. Jump would remain long among them, as such Frequent changes in the heads of the force were neither good for the force nor the public. (Hear. hear.) He had not known .Supt. Jump very long, but the more he knew of him the better ho liked him, and he was sure the men had mound in him a sympathetic superintendent. (Applause.) He had seen good effects springing from thew social meetings at Haslingdon and _acerington. Tim members looked forward with pleasure to lien gatherings, and the exchange of views among them tooted to the good of the form, end was also beneficial to the public. (Applause.) He proposed the health of the Roisendale force and bowling tram, which was drunk with musical honours. Supt.

Mr. (killings expos-mil the pleasure he had felt on every occasion that the police had met on the green. He was sure it was a benefit to the police force and the public, as the police got to know men better, and they also got same of their corners rubbed off them. (Laughter, and hear, tear.) Mr. Baxter alio responded, and said that the committee granted the consent unanimously for the police to have the use of the green. and it bail been a pleasure for the officiaLs and members to welcome them.

Captain Slinger appeared for the prosecution, ' stet Mr. Kahl Whitaker for the defence. Captain Slinger said the charge. a eerieen one, was that of receiving stolen goals when knowing them to have been stolen. The SUbjeCt iii the lebarge cancistesi of 60tbs. of brass, the property lof Messrs. Iloward and Bullough, which vraa stolen use or six weeks prior to its being found on the premises of the defendant Gregory. llregory was a marine store dealer, and Entwistle was in his employ. On the 18th of the present month. P.C. l'ippings vainest Gregory's pistol.% under a search warrant, whats it should to. stated, wan not taken out in connection with this particular case. Whiled searching he found in a rartitioned room a sack contaising the brass, winch the prosecution alleged bad been stolen by someone from Messrs. Howard and Bullisugh's. The constable ereptiod the cientonts of the sack on the floor, and .Gregrey at once said it waa all right . he had ,braught it off a dealer. The constable went on to enquire about details. and it was then the defendant told him he must find oat. It was for tint Bench to any whether that would be Illsely to be the reply of a man who had come by ge.ls bori. ratty and legitimately, and the onuu was upon the defer lent to any whether he .me by the bran, in a legitimate manner. When interviewed at the petite station, the defendant Entwistle said lie purchased the bra. for Lis m.ter from a man who gave his name as Turner, of Wmleytstreet, alai gave bit. Bd. for it. As a matter of fact the brass was worth £3 las., and had been identified by Mr. Leath., a foreman, as tho property of Messrs. Howard and Bullough. P.C. Tipping, who t, stationed at C-hunch, stated that on Tuottlay evening, the 18th, he entered the marine store of Gregory under a warrant which, however, did not relate to the present case. In a partitioned room inside the store he found the sack and brass produced, as well an other brass. He emptied the sack on the stone room floor, in the rottbnce of Gregory, who said. ""That's all right. I bought that off a dealer."" When the constable asked who the dealer was, and how much he gave for it, Gregory replied ""You must find out."" lie a! Ii mania took the brans to Church Police Station and found it weighed 60Ibe. The day following it was shown to Mr. Leach, who identified it as the property of How'arti and Buillough. Witness had spine conversation with the defendant Entwistle, who stated that he bought it ahetit five weeks ago off a man who gave his name as Turner, living in Wealey-street, Accrington. and gave bs. gel. fei it. When asked whether he bought the bras by weight. Entwistle replied ""No, I gave so meea for the lot."" ho crom-examination, the Constable said he had , known the defendant Gregory for about twelve months, and no far as he knew them was nothing against his character until the present charge. He was formerly a marine store dealer and a worker' in the mill. Jam. Leach, Richmond Hill-street, foreman in Howard and Buliough's moulding department. identified the braon produced as the property of the firm, it lmving, been moulded at the work,. He identified tho brass by the cutting, because he did not believe there was another firm in the country that used a mill liko those used by Howard end Bullough. It was not scrap brass. and no one had any right to remove it from the promisee. The bra. vetuld -have been taken after the last stook-taking, which was just after Whit-week. In cross-examination, Mr. Leach mid he hal vorked at Howard and Bullough's all his life. Up to she police teeing him he had not had omitsills to miss any brass, and he did not know any had been taken only from the fact that it was produced. There would he 10 or 15 tons of the brans in stock at the time. •Re-examinedi The milling was his own design, so then, could be no doubt about identification. Detective Ashcroft said he nerved the defendants with summonses on the 21st, and after being miul over to them Gregory replied, ""I only know what Entwistle told me."" Entwistle mak, no reply. In the course of an able speech for tho dote Mr. Kidd Whitaker pointed out the very aerierni nature of the charge which was agaiiwt IM2II who up to now had an exceedingly -honourable record. Before they could ray there wan a prima facie rase against the defendants of receiving property knowing it to have been stolen, they must really Ire natisfied that a theft had been committed, and in this respect he held it had not been clearly established that the brasdid belong to Bullough's. Then again, no amount of catelessnera in itself would warrant them in saying that the defendants had any felonious intention. He admitted there had not been that degree of care that ought to have been exercised, but that was not suffieent, and they must satisfy themselves beyond the shadow cf a doubt that then, existed in the minds of the defendants a guilty knowledge that the brass% was stolen.  Defendant replied in the affirmative. The Chairman said defendant had been teaching boys to be thieves, which was a terrible thing. He had idso given them an inducement to lc wicked. They hail decided to fine defendant snit costs in the first cam, in default a nnintil'o imprimnment. In two of the other oaseo he would have to pay the costs , go to prison for seven days in each care. In the last race he would alm be fined £5 and costs, with the alternative of a month's imprisonment. the sentences to run cam enutively. He would also have to get his pricuics registered. The fines were paid.  Both defendants gave evidence. Grogory Mating I that he had never purchased heavy brags such as I that rpoducosl, and he gavo Entwbtle orders not to I do It was a day or two after Entwistle had mado tho purchass that he told witness, who said ho had done wrong. Entwistle said it was on May 16th that a man. who gave his mime as Turoor, a &tiler, offered him the brags for E.. 9d., which ho accepted. It was true Gregory hail told him not to buy heavy brass, but he said he thought the brass was mined with iron. In fact. he did not look into tho each batons he made the purchase. John William Noble, formerly a °oilier, said he wee in Gregory's shop when the man Turner came in with the sack, which h. said eonta.ined brass and iron. Ile saw Entwistle make the purchase. The man who cold tho goode was of dark tomplosion. had a dark moustache and dark hair, and stood about Oft. 4 incl., Ike Bench coromittod defendants to Preston for trial, allowing bail in £4O each and a rarely of £lO.

It put 1111 Catholic schools the badge of inferiority. It out incomprehensible how any man in his senses could say it wan just to call upon dm Catholics to pay school rates for the public schools, sad then pay mei- again for the maintenance of their own. If the rates paid by Catholic, in this country nere ear-marked and parted, they would be sufficient to pay for every Catholic school in tht- country. Catholics could only look at. contracting-out if it were shown to be the only means of saving their Catholic schools; but even then they could not accept it at the haunt named by the Government, for 475. pt-r child would mean starvation and ruin for Catholic schools over a great portion of Great Britain.

NONCONFORMIST PROPAGANDA FOR THE UNION. • When Mr. Chamberlain declared reeently that a revulsion of political feeling had talou place in the country aimse the last general election, he also intimated that Ile MU nut giving utt, ranee to mere rash or irresponsible opinions, but was speaking from detinite information. Probably moist people will be inclined to attsibute the change in popular sentiment to the imaiwilese arid untiring saurus which the Unionists have made by means of public meetings and demonstrationa to enlighten the British *lector upon the dangsre of 11,00s.rtils• No doubt these have bean of inietimable value, but at the name time due iniportancs ought also to be attached to • lam ostmitat ions but n3ua the lose effective propaganda which Ira., keen warred for Imany months paid in this trountry by the Nonermfamine of the North of Ii elend. Those storly Loyalists have noted with dismay that their Dire brethren on this eide of the Channel are gerierally in favour of the establishment of an Irish Legislature Everything prelim indubitably to the Foot that an Irish Parlianent would be doniinated I by the Homan Catholic, hievirchy. Snob a Leyte[ adorn, practically governed on it would be by a prejudiced priesthood, could nut fail to be a conrutaut menace to their religi:rus liberties, as well as to their civil rights. The Irish Nonconformists hove always believed that if once the truth were presented to the professed Bones - robins of England and Scotland toer approval of the measure would vanish, and accordingly some time ago the General Assembly of the Irish Presbyterian Ohurulm resolved to put the theory into practice, land to send a number of their ablest minister, to I this conntry to discuss with their clerical brethren in Engiand in the privacy of their own homes every phase and aspect of the Home-rule question, giving them the fullest information not only with regard to the intensity and fervour of their opposition to Home-rule, but as to the reasons upon which that hostility is bated. Few Englishmen have any idea either of the importance or the extensive character of this lstest "" Plan of Campaign."" London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh ore the cities upon which attention has so far been chiefly bestowed. The mudus opirandi has been to select the meet influential Dissenting ministers in these Owen—men like the Rue. Dr. Parker, the Rev. Guinness Rogers, the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, and others, who wield great personal influence in their respective spheree. To these thibest informed ministere from Ulster have been despatched, and there is every reason to believe that the interviews thus arranged have borne fruit in the dissemination of truth where formerly the greenest fellacies and miscouceptions prevailed. A few days ago • repreeentative of the "" Courier "" had the privilege of an interview with • one of the Ulster men who has beim engaged in this work of political evaugelisation—the Rev. J. W. Gamble, Presbyterian minister of Lisixtris thriving little torso a few miles from Belfast. The General Assembly could not have male a happier choice than when they selected Mr. Gamble for this delicate duty. No man is better qualified to impart information to hie cosreligioniste in England upon toe ruinous coneequenme, politically, commercially, and socially, of establishing a Dublin Parliament. Hs lion occupied his present position fur upwards of tun years, but prior to that time he had spent the whole of his life in the heart of • Hume-rule wooly. Moreover, until the Home-rule hill of 1886 wait produced he had never been is any sense a politician, but had alweys devoted himiself exclusively to miuisterial and clerical work. None can therefore ascribe his present attitude to political bias or partisanship. Mr. Gamble is indeed a type of hundreds who have been drivco against their Meters into politica, • solely because they believe the ruin of their ~country is involved in the proposed change in its government. Ain view of the question was al. Inject to more than once during the interview, and Mr. Gamble pointed to the absolute unanimity of • the Protestants of the North in their resistance to Home-rule. "" I myself, for example,"" he remarked, ""have spent upwards of six weeks is interviewing prominent ministers in Ireland, and I sin oarrying on this woik with the full commit of my congregation.""  Questioned es to his experiences in London, the rev. gentleman stated that nearly ovely fallacy which be and his ooadjutors bad to combat was traceable to Mr,Gladstons'a speech's. These . formed the mainspring of most of the errors and misconceptions which they found so widely prerelent. ""Did you make amity converts ?"" ""That I can hardly say. We were asked for information, and having given it.to the boat of our ' ability, we lett our interrogators to digest it. i:ionie of the ministers WO saw were MUM outopoken than nthers, as, for instance, the Rev. Dr. Parker, who, after several interviews, declared that he WSee entirely with us."" The Rev. Guinness Rogers was aloe one of the ministers interviewed by Mr. Gamble and his friend. Oar readers will doubtless remember that it wee atiMr. Guinness Rogers' house where Mr. Gladstone met the now famous gathering of English ISonoonLirmiat ministers, and made to then, his hietoric epeeoli about the "" rogues and [oohs of' Ulster.""  ""Mr. Guinness Rogers admitted to es,"" remarked Mr. Gamble, "" that he WWI by no MAUR »arislied with the present personnel of the Irish party. Indeed he went as far as to say that he would not meet several of them socielly."" ""I pteaumn his objection was due to their sasocistion with crime and criminals?"" Precieely. At the Who time be expressed his belief that when a Dublin Parliament was created the party would undergo a change fur the better."" "" Whet realness did be. *Adm.-6 for that Opinion? ""None whatever,"" replied Mr. Gamble, "" and we can teens it o,oii tor chancing our views on the subject. Every member of the Irish Parliamentary party ht.s to be formally approved of by the biehope and the prieste of hie constituency. We know as • matter of fact that the approval has been of neesireity obtained in the case of every menilier of the party led by Mr. Justin Weattliy, whether he be Proterstant de Roman Catholic. In a self-governed Ireland the ! priests would select their own nominees just as at , present,and whet guarantee have we that the men acceptable to them now will eat be just an rompsable to them in the future I"" Qur oonversetion then turned upon the supposed to ration of the Irish Romanestlarlice in allowing several Protestants to represent them in Parka, inenti. Mr. Gamble declered that it was an astute move which had to receive the previous sanction of the bishops and the privets ; nod, moreover, not one Protestant Burns-ruler representing an Irish constituency was an action member of the Presbyterian Church. Where such men were elected on the sufferance of the pri.nts tiers was always MOEN special reason for it, either in the character of the members thetswel vire or in the define of the Rumanians to Oct a convenient argument against their opponent, Mr. Gamble Instanced Mr. Jeremiah .bides ea a striking example of his contention. "" Were you confronted with this argument about Roman Catholic toleration in any of your inter v iews ?' "" 'rite Rev. Hugh Price Norbert appeared to attach great importance to it, but Sitr•r whet Was said to him I think he will drop Mr. Jeremiah Jordan, at all events fur the Noire."" Do you believe the oupitetist4 would withdraw their moony frinn Ireland if the Rome-rule bill were granted ?"" ""I would hardly go no fur as to say thee, brat I know as • matter of tact that they would- invest not • farthing more than the demands of their businew required.

The Cloth of Estate has had no definite existence in the minds of men until today. What their lordships mean is that when the Queen opens Parliament the Duke of Clarence and Avondale must have his place on the left of the throne, his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Duke of Connaught alone being before him. News has reached Vienna by mail from Bucharest of an atrocious crime committed near the village of Strosci, in the Rimnik district. A few evenings ago a peasant named Constantin °bra caoco, returning to his home in Strosci from • neighbouring Tillage, when he had sold • calf, with 20 francs in his pocket, was set upon while pinning through the woods by two other peasants, who demanded his money. Obrocacoo relmed, and the men thereupon bound him to a tree and cut his eyes out. The unfortunate man then delivered up his money, and the robbers proceeded to kill him by slow torture. They pierced his breast with a long sharp knife, and when he begged for his life in the name of his wife and children they cut his tongue out. After the man was dead, the robbers became conscience stricken. They ran to the village justice and related the circumstances of the crime. They were put in irons; and it was only by strategy that the authorities were able to prevent their being lynched by the people. The will of the late Mr Robert Needham Philips, of the Park, Prestwich, and Welcombe, near Stratford-upon-Avon, Waruickahire, who died on the 4th March, has een proved in the Manchester District Registry of the Court of Probate, the gross personal estate being sworn at £441,811 is 7d Net 1428,087 .14s 7d), including leaseholds.
